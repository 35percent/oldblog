A [report](http://www.spinwatch.org/index.php/component/k2/item/5458-the-local-lobby-and-the-failure-of-democracy) by journalist Anna Minton has found that _"20  per  cent  of  Southwarkâ€™s  63 councillors work as lobbyists"_ for developers in the planning industry and that a significant number of Councillors and Council officers are making use of a _'well-oiled revolving door'_ to the industry. This is twice the already alarming [average number](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/apr/29/nearly-100-london-councillors-have-links-to-property-industry) of Councillors working in the property development industry in other London boroughs. Here we have documented a few of Southwark's most striking revolving door examples.

## Councillors

## Jeremy Fraser
<img src="http://35percent.org/img/jeremyfraser.png" style="margin:10px" align="left" height="150">After [kick-starting](http://www.newstatesman.com/node/150435) Southwark's Blairite social cleansing programme, Southwark's Labour Council leader [Jeremy Fraser](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/jeremy-fraser-362a6a2a) lost his seat in 2002.

## Nick Stanton

In 2009, he was [critcised for lack of transparency](http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/4230) after [selecting Lend Lease](http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/4712) as the council's development partner in 2007, is now an [Associate Director](http://curtinandco.com/profiles/nick-stanton-obe/) for property development PR company 'Curtin & Co'. On Stanton's profile page for the company he writes _"I enjoy working on strategic allocations enabling controversial sites to come forward for development."_ Under his list of major accomplishments he boasts _"Winning approval at committee for a major development on a greenfield site"_ Amongst others, Curtin is currently advising developers on the controversial [Southwark Metals development](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/lib-dem-deputy-investigated-over-lobbying-8395968.html) in Bermondsey for which Stanton's local political party received a donation. Stanton resurfaced working for Shard developer Irvine Sellar in 2013, when he [helped](/img/Regeneration-and-Major-Projects.pdf) Sellar secure planning consent for 1046 new homes at [Canada Water (Decathlon site)](http://35percent.org/canada-water/#canada-water-sites-ce).

This was good news for Newington, as Tom is not only a sitting Councillor but he is also on the Council's planning committee where he is clearly well placed to influence planning decisions. Whilst we are not suggesting any wrongdoing, a real potential for conflict of interest clearly exists. Newington's full [list of clients](http://newingtoncomms.co.uk/our-clients) includes major developers such as Barratt, Berkeley, British Land, Countryside Properties and Grosvenor - all of which have major development/land interests in Southwark.

Allies & Morrison was [part of the Lend Lease consortium](http://m.building.co.uk/lend-lease-wins-%C2%A315bn-regeneration-of-elephant-and-castle/3092038.article) that won the bid to become the council's development partner for the E&C regeneration.

Having fully [staircased](/img/LR_76RoffoCourt.pdf) their ownership of the flat just a year after moving in, Cllr Garfield stood down in 2015 after being [found guilty](http://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/labour-whip-in-the-dock-after-beating-his-wife/) of assaulting Cllr Lury.

Cllr Lury's ward is North Walworth, which comprises the [Heygate](http://35percent.org/heygate-regeneration-faq/) and [Aylesbury](http://35percent.org/aylesbury-estate/) estates. She is also Cabinet member for 'Equalities and Communities', despite government findings that the Council had [breached the human rights](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/16/government-blocks-controversial-plan-to-force-out-housing-estate-residents) of residents being expelled by the Aylesbury regeneration. Cllr Lury is therefore well placed to advise developers on controversial matters in property and planning.

Cllr Fleming along with Cllr Garfield were the only two people to stand up and speak in support of the Aylesbury redevelopment at the [planning application hearing in 2015](http://35percent.org/2015-04-26-aylesbury-applications-approved/). He also spoke at a [Council meeting](http://youtu.be/GlTuN-ffEZk) against [Aylesbury leaseholders](http://halag.wordpress.com) being offering like-for-like replacements for their homes on a council estate elsewhere in the borough. Councillor Fleming is Southwark's only Councillor to [describe](http://pwfpwfpwf.blogspot.co.uk/2016/06/why-i-have-no-choice-but-to-keepcorbyn.html) himself as both a Jacobite and a Corbynite and to [publicly endorse](http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/8825) Jeremy Corbyn's leadership.

According to her [LinkedIn](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/fionacolley) profile Fiona now works as an independent consultant advising tech companies on how to get contracts with local authorities. During her time on the Council, she oversaw the conception of many regeneration schemes including the Heygate estate and Canada Water regeneration. She liked the latter scheme so much that she bought two flats off-plan from the developer (and then flipped them on once they had been built)[^1].  

## Catherine Bowman

She was also Cabinet Member for Regeneration and progressed to the hold the position as deputy Council leader under the brief Lib-Dem/Tory administration. She went on to [work for developer Berkeley Homes](https://uk.linkedin.com/pub/catherine-bowman/86/291/76b) as an 'External Affairs Advisor' and then set up shop with former deputy leader Kim Humphries under the name of ['Carvil Ventures Ltd'](http://carvil-ventures.co.uk/).

## Mark Williams
<img src="http://35percent.org/img/markwilliamskatharinemorshead.jpg" width="160" style="margin:10px" align="left">Mark Williams is the current Labour administration's Cabinet member for Regeneration. It wasn't until 2016 that he registered his wife's occupation under his [register of interests](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/mgDeclarationSubmission.aspx?UID=1800&HID=1824&FID=0&HPID=620269417).

No need to wonder then where Southwark's love affair with PRS development has originated. The [New Southwark Plan](http://www.2.southwark.gov.uk/downloads/download/4346/new_southwark_plan_preferred_option) has a whole section praising the merits of PRS and at Elephant & Castle alone the Council is giving planning consent for nearly 2000 PRS homes.
