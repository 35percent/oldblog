The Aylesbury estate is a symbol; it is the symbol of an architecture and politics at odds with the values of recent times.

It was no coincidence that the estate was selected by Tony Blair for his [first speech as prime minister](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/blairs-pledge-to-the-dark-estates-1253883.html) in 1997, where he [said](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/news/06/0602/blair.shtml) there must be no more _"no-hope areas"_ in new Labour's Britain. 

>"Behind the statistics lie households where three generations have never had a job. There are estates where the biggest employer is the drugs industry, where all that is left of the high hopes of the post-war planners is derelict concrete. Behind the statistics are people who have lost hope, trapped in fatalism." (Tony Blair, inaugural speech, May 1997) 

Blair vowed to _'learn from the mistakes of the past'_ and replace the dogma of bygone housing policies with pragmatism and common sense. 

## Dogma vs pragmatism
History has shown us that the Aylesbury regeneration has been driven wholly by a stigmatisation of the architecture and the people who live on the estate. The local council ignored the residents' ballot which rejected redevelopment and pushed through the Aylesbury Area Action Plan. 

Our __Aylesbury Alternative Plan__ drawn up by residents and experts aims to restore pragmatism and common sense to the scheme. Our plans will keep the best of the existing urban environment whilst acknowleding the need for an uplift in housing by providing for a degree of in-fill redevelopment. It is a vision of a more green and civic-minded estate.

Council [briefing papers](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s63817/Report.Aylesbury%20Regeneration%20Delivery.pdf) show that it is spending over Â£40m on the Aylesbury scheme during the next two years alone. We will present a robust business case for refurbisment. At a time of unprecedented budget cuts and a growing black hole in the council's finances, we show how our alternative plan is better not just socially and environmentally, but also economically. 

## The Wendover blocks
The most iconic component of the Aylesbury estate are the Wendover blocks. These two long blocks dissect the estate, running from North to South continuously.

*Wendover blocks highlighted in yellow*

The blocks were designed such that there was free movement on the ground level. However, this space has been sealed off by the council, creating an unpermeable and hostile environment. Our plan will restore this public realm and create new communal spaces to enhance the urban environment and fulfil regeneration objectives.

## Call for architects/planners:
We will be submitting our plans sometime next year. Please get in touch if you would like to get involved in the AAP project, any input would be greatly appreciated. Help us restore the Aylesbury estate to its former glory!
