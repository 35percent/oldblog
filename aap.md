The Aylesbury estate is a symbol; it is the symbol of an architecture and politics at odds with the aesthetic of recent times.

It was no coincidence that the estate was selected by Tony Blair for his [first speech as prime minister](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/blairs-pledge-to-the-dark-estates-1253883.html) in 1997, where he [said](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/news/06/0602/blair.shtml) there must be no more _"no-hope areas"_ in new Labour's Britain. 

>"Behind the statistics lie households where three generations have never had a job. There are estates where the biggest employer is the drugs industry, where all that is left of the high hopes of the post-war planners is derelict concrete. Behind the statistics are people who have lost hope, trapped in fatalism." (Tony Blair, inaugural speech, May 1997) 

Blair vowed to _'learn from the mistakes of the past'_ and replace the dogma of bygone housing policies with pragmatism and common sense. 

## Dogma vs pragmatism
Given that the Aylesbury regeneration has been driven largely by infallible dogma to date, the __Aylesbury Alternative Plan__ aims to restore pragmatism and common sense to the scheme.

 .. pragmatic approach .. keeping the best of the existing urban environment whilst acknowleding the need for an uplift in housing.

Austerity - we show how our alternative plan is better not just socially and environmentally, but also economically as it will require lower capital expenditure for the Council. 

The most iconic/symbolic part of the estate is the Wendover blocks - two long blocks running disecting the estate from North to South, running continuously
