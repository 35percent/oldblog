The Aylesbury estate is a symbol; it is the symbol of an architecture and politics at odds with the aesthetic of recent times.

It was no coincidence that the estate was selected by Tony Blair for his [first speech as prime minister](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/blairs-pledge-to-the-dark-estates-1253883.html) in 1997, where he [said](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/news/06/0602/blair.shtml) there must be no more _"no-hope areas"_ in new Labour's Britain. 

>"Behind the statistics lie households where three generations have never had a job. There are estates where the biggest employer is the drugs industry, where all that is left of the high hopes of the post-war planners is derelict concrete. Behind the statistics are people who have lost hope, trapped in fatalism." (Tony Blair, inaugural speech, May 1997) 

Blair vowed to _'learn from the mistakes of the past'_ and replace the dogma of bygone housing policies with pragmatism and common sense. 

## Dogma vs pragmatism
History having now shown that the Aylesbury regeneration has been driven wholly by nothing but infallible dogma to date, the __Aylesbury Alternative Plan__ aims to restore pragmatism and common sense to the scheme.

Our plans aim to keep the best of the existing urban environment whilst acknowleding the need for an uplift in housing by providing for a degree of in-fill redevelopment.

Council [briefing papers](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s63817/Report.Aylesbury%20Regeneration%20Delivery.pdf) show that it is spending over Â£40m on the Aylesbury scheme during the next two years alone. We aim to present a robust business case for refurbisment - at a time of unprecedented budget cuts and a growing black hole in the council's finances, we show how our alternative plan is better not just socially and environmentally, but also economically as it has a significantly lower capital expenditure requirement.

## The Wendover blocks
The most iconic component of the Aylesbury estate is the Wendover blocks. These two long blocks disect the estate, running from North to South continuously.

The blocks were designed such that there was free movement on ground level underneath them. However this space has been sealed off by the council creating an unpermeable and hostile environment. Our plan will restore this public realm and create new communal spaces to enhance the urban environment and fulfil regeneration objectives.

Our objective is submit an application for a CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATE ALTERNATIVE DEVELOPMENT under SECTION 17 OF THE PLANNING COMPENSATION ACT 1991 and present the alternative plan to the CPO public inquiry for the Wendover phase in late 2018.
