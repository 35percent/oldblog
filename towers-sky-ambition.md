The last ten years has seen a flurry of high-profile, high-density, high-rise developments approved by Southwark - but how have they benefitted the community. The following table shows a number of major schemes approved almost exclusively by the current administration and the number of social rented homes in each development.

It is fair to say that in some of the schemes, developers have provided a 'commuted sum' in lieu of providing any affordable housing. However, as [pointed out by local news site SE1](http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/8222) these sums are often equal to the price of just one penthouse apartment.

Towers, sky and ambition is all very well, but dreams and visions eventually become reality..
