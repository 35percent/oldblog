## Background - how we discovered the problem
In preparing evidence for submission to the 2015 Aylesbury estate CPO public inquiry we were investigating Notting Hill Genesis's involvement in Southwark regeneration schemes to date - Silwood estate, Wood Dene estate and the Bermondsey Spa regeneration.

We found that one of the schemes was in the [2014 GLA funding round listed](http://35percent.org/img/GLA+Affordable+Housing+Dataset_v1_0-1.xls) as 'affordable rent' tenure with rents listed as up to 62% of market rent.

We asked a local Councillor to get in touch with the housing association to confirm the rent levels it was charging. Notting Hill Genesis [responded](http://35percent.org/img/nottinghillexchange.pdf) that all of the homes that were supposed to be social rent were being let at affordable rent.

> Dear Cllr Johnson, We don't have any social rented properties here, but our policy forAffordable Rent sets the rent at whichever is the lowest of 80% of marketrent, LHA caps, and our own caps. In the case of this scheme we areaveraging a rent level of 58% of market rent, ranging from 42% for the 3beds to 63% for the 1 beds.

We also checked the Council's [choice-based letting system](https://www.southwarkhomesearch.org.uk/) and found the homes being advertised at rents well above social rent levels.

We were somewhat surprised that there didn't seem to be any control

In the Council's [28 Jan 2016 response](/img/Stage1response28Jan2016.pdf) to our complaint, Southwark's Director of Planning said that _â€˜Southwark Council has appropriate safeguards in place and has not failed in its duties .. therefore your compliant is not upheld"._

It was clear to us that if Southwark did have 'appropriate safeguards' in place then Notting Hill Genesis's tenure switch at Bermondsey Spa would not have occured.. 

We subsequently contacted Southwark's Cabinet member for Regeneration in an attempt to raise the matter further and in June 2016, we met with him and two senior officers from the planning department. We were assured that the Council had efficient monitoring procedures in place but officers were unable to explain the details of what those monitoring procedures were or how the Bermondsey Spa homes had switched tenure, or the inconsistencies with the GLA data.

We then referred the complaint to the Ombudsman that..

GLA no longer publishes scheme-level data - why doesn't Southwark access OPS system which does contain specific addresses?
Why no crossover with the Housing Department? allocations policy = 100% nominations?
