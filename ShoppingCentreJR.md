## BTS/BTR hybrid scheme review mechanism failure - Social rent
The S106 agreement for the scheme fails to secure the viability review mechanism for uplift in social rented housing relating to the Build-to-Sell (BTS) scheme option agreed by the planning committee. 

On xxth December 2016, the developer applied for planning permission for the redevelopment of E&C shopping centre and UAL campus to include 979 new residential units, all of which to be provided as 'Build to Rent' (BTR) accommodation. 

Planning policy governing BTR schemes is currently still 'emerging'. According to Southwark's draft NSP at the time of the planning application, the tenure mix requirement for a BTR scheme had a lower requirement for social rented accommodation 12% (34% of 35%). This draft policy requirement of 34% has since been increased to 43% in the latest draft of the NSP (15% of total). The draft NSP requires a significantly greater proportion (25%) social rented tenure (70% of 35%) for BTS schemes. The existing 2012 E&C SPD requires 17.5% (50% of 35%).

On xxth April 2018, nearly 18 months since the planning application was submitted and only eight? weeks before it went before the planning committee, the developer applied for a revision to the application enabling it the option to build a BTS instead of a BTR scheme on the West Site.

Whilst the Council's independent advisors GVA had scrutinised the proposed BTR scheme in its 153-page [June 2017 report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!PHUQPPiesgvQWEZYj1nx%2fw%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) and had conducted a scenario analysis for a BTS scheme across both East and West sites, it had not considered or scrutinised this new hybrid proposal for a part BTS/part BTR scheme. 

This is confirmed in GVA's [13th April 2018 letter](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!LXcCuPkZXfUd47qX5Tcdtg%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) to the Council, in which it says
_'We have been asked by the Planning Department to provide our comments on the latest Affordable Housing offer from the Applicant.'_

GVA says: _'We have not modelled an option whereby the West Site is assessed for viability on a standalone basis on a build to sell route. We will await your specific instructions in this regard before we look at this potential scenario.'_

GVA observes that _'The BTS offer on the West Site would still offer 35% Affordable Quantum. We acknowledge that a BTS alternative falls into a different test in terms of tenure split with policy being 50:50 Social Rent and Shared Ownership.'_ 

GVA concludes that _'We are also advised by London Borough of Southwark that in a BTS scenario for the West Site, the shortfall in social rented housing from the East Site, would need to be made up on the West Site. Whilst the overall quantum would remain at 35%, the proportion of social rented housing on the West Site would have to reflect the West Site provision plus the East Site shortfall.'_

In summary, not only is there a higher social rented requirement in a BTS scheme on the West Site but it also needs to encompass the social rented requirement carried over from the East Site scheme, which is providing no social rented housing.

The [3 July 2018 planning committee report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!HvOs1eG7BYgl0hYZ8SIm5w%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) appears to take into account these issues and assures the planning committee that this will be taking care of by the S106 agreement. Paragraph 365 of the report entitled __'Fall-back position'__ says:

> "The applicant also wishes to retain a fall-back position whereby the west site could be delivered as traditional build-to-sell units. The exception to this would be the social rented units in the mansion blocks which would be delivered in any event. The developer would notify the Council, of the intention to develop the west site as build to sell, and the affordable housing requirement for this would be for 50% social rented and 50% intermediate. Some of the west site’s social rented units would already be secured in the mansion blocks, albeit 38% rather than the 50% requirement, therefore a review mechanism would be required."

This is repeated further in paragraph 404 of the officer report:

> "In the event that the West site is delivered as open market for sale the review will need to take into account the policy requirement for a different tenure split of 50:50 social rented and intermediate."

However the S106 agreement's review mechanism fails to secure this increase in social rented housing required by a BTS scheme. The review provisions for the West Site (pages 130-134) in the event of a BTS scheme are silent on the higher tenure split requirement and restrict any proceeds from any uplift in viability to the provision of London Living Rent not Social Rent. See definition of 'Additional Affordable Housing' defined on page 8 of the S106 agreement and referred to by the review mechanism (pages 130-134):

In summary, the Planning Committee was misled to believe that a robust review mechanism would ensure that any BTS option on the West Site would provide an additional proportion of social rented units in line with the different policy requirements of a BTS. The review mechanism in the S106 fails in this regard.

Delancey can now opt to deliver a more profitable BTS scheme on the West Site (14% IRR vs 11%) without providing the number of social rented homes required by policy for a BTS scheme. The floorspace calculations below show that this will result in the hybrid BTS/BTR scheme providing less than half the amount of social rented housing required by policy. This will result in the failure to create the mixed community envisaged by and meet the housing need required by the local development plan. 

Further, paragraph 402 of the planning committee report says that _"in view of the fact that the affordable housing provides a compliant quantum of 35% but has a non-compliant tenure split, and in line with the Council's Development Viability SPD, a viability review (VR) would be required. This is to ensure that if the economic circumstances of the scheme change in the future an improved tenure split can be achieved in order to be more closely if not fully compliant with policy. The detailed requirements for the viability reviews will be secured within the S106 legal agreement."_

Paragraph 405 says _"Any uplift above the agreed IRR of 11% as set out in the final FVA would be applied to increase the percentage of affordable units at the social rent equivalent and London Living Rent equivalent units with the aim of getting closer to a policy compliant level."_

The practical implications of this are that the S106 agreement fails to ensure that any uplift in the viability of the scheme, regardless of which option is pursued, will provide any extra social rented housing.

In addition, the viability review mechanism for the BTS scheme assumes different assumptions - a higher overall profit level (14% IRR) for which there is no agreement (the letter from GVA says that they haven't reviewed the BTS West Site scheme) and 17.5% profit on residential GDV which we know from the draft S106 that Southwark didn't want to agree (see draft S106 where LBS said 17.5% was not agreed and wanted 12.5% instead).

Indeed, because it was introduced at such late notice, there has been no independent viability review of the hybrid BTS West Site/BTR East Site scheme. This is despite the planning committee report's assertions that the FVA has been appraised and agreed (paras 391,392). The 35% Campaign pointed this out in its representations to the Council prior to the planning committee hearing. 

Paragraph 864 of the planning committee report summarises the objections submitted by the 35% Campaign:

* _"Object to the developer being able to confirm the tenure of the west site dwellings after permission is granted;"_

* _"Unreasonable to expect the Planning Committee to decide the merits of the scheme without knowing the precise tenure of over half of the homes;"_

* _"The viability implications of a built to rent / build to sell scheme have not been addressed by the applicant;"_

* _"The affordable housing offer uses arguments in support of build to rent, which would not be relevant if half the scheme were build to sell;"_

* _"Object to the affordable housing offer being based on emerging policy P4 of the draft New Southwark Plan if half the units would be build to sell;"_

* _"Introducing build to sell will confuse the affordable housing requirement. Saved policy 4.4 should apply for the whole site, regardless of whether it is for sale or rent;"_

* _"Applicant does not elaborate on what other changes may be required to the west site if it is build to sell;"_

Paragraph 900 of the planning committee report confirms that 92 separate representations have been received which include the objection that the _"Option for a build to sell scheme undermines the developer’s viability appraisal;"_ 


## Grant Funding
The 'Application Viability Appraisal' (appendix 10) relied upon by the S106 review mechanism is based on 'with grant funding' -> so review mechanisms and prospect of an improved affordable housing mix will be severely compromised if grant funding is not allocated. - it will leave an £11.3m black hole in the viability of the scheme.

The Mayors 2016-2021 AH Programme requires affordable homes funded by this programme [to have starts on site by March 2022](https://www.london.gov.uk/decisions/md2282-additional-funding-affordable-homes). This is clearly feasible for the East Site but not possible for the West Site because Delancey must first build UAL's campus (on the East site) before it can even take possession of the West site.  

The Mayor's stage 2 final report said that with grant funding he had been able to improve the affordable housing offer and ensure that all DMR rents will be reduced to the £60k affordability threshold. But the S106 doesn't reflect this - DMR rents are still listed as being in the £60k to £90k affordability bracket.

## Are Social rented units on West Site really secured in event of stalled scheme?
Para 364 of the OR says _"The affordable housing proposed would also not be evenly distributed across both sites, with the social rented units all being delivered on the west site. The s106 agreement would therefore stipulate that if the development on the west site has not substantially commenced within 10 years of the east site commencing, the land and sum of money sufficient for construction and completion of the social rented units would be transferred to the Council, to deliver the social rented units."_

However the S106 agreement fails to secure this. The Council is given two options in the event of a stalled scheme - see options 2 and 3 in paras 3.5.2 and 3.5.3 (page 118). Option 2 enables the land to be transferred and Delancey pays 'Net SR Construction Costs', which is listed in the definitions section not as the estimated or actual constructions costs but the DIFFERENCE between the (agreed) estimated construction and demolitions costs (£37.8m plus £?? demolition) of the SR units and NR floorspace and the (agreed) estimated value (£26.6 for SR units - £23m for NR).

Option 3 requires the Council to pay for both the social rented housing and non-residential floorspace.

## Floorspace figures
It is difficult to quote affordable housing statistics when calculated by habitable room as the applicant and Council have used. Using floorspace gives a more accurate overview as it takes into account different dwelling types and room sizes. It also also encouraged by policy (NSP & London Plan):

> "Applicants should present affordable housing figures as a percentage of total residential provision by habitable rooms, by units and by floorspace to enable comparison." (Policy 2.8)
 
Page 16 of the planning statement confirms there will be 106,500 sqm of residential floorspace (GIA). Split evenly between the East and West sites.
The [Accommodation Schedule](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!9e1lINlEHTmcLt5vZsm29g%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) shows that the 116 social rented units on the West Site comprise just 9,141 sqm - (8.6%) of the overall total residential floorspace. 

The [planning statement](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!LnbCaTCiMmUoN4H%2fUA2yyg%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) confirms that there will be 50,428 sqm of residential floorspace on the East Site and 56,043 sqm of residential on the West Site. 

A policy-compliant hybrid BTS/BTR scheme would therefore need to provide 15,859 sqm of Social Rented accommodation (6,051 sqm (12%) on the BTR East Site and 9,808 sqm (17.5%) on the BTS West Site). Instead the S106 secures just over half of this amount (9,141sqm). 

* Total residential on East Site = 50,428sqm (Social Rent@12% = 6,051sqm)

* Total residential on West Site (BTS) = 56,043 (Social Rent@17.5% = 9,808sqm)

* Total SR requirement under hybrid BTS/BTR scheme = 15,859sqm (6,051sqm+9,808sqm)

So, as a result of the S106 drafting failure if Delancey opts to exercise the BTS option, the scheme will provide just over half (57%) of the social rented housing that the planning committee was told it would provide. This is a loss of approximately 100 much-needed social rented homes.

## FVA discrepancies
The Council's independent advisors produced a report for the pl anning committee in which a cost was listed in every FVA saying that there was a £15m CPO cost. It says it was provided this assumption by Delancey and that it was in the process of verifying it:

![](/img/sccpo.png)

Planning Committee report said that Delancey's viability assessment had been reviewed by GVA and that assumptions had been agreed. But the draft S106 shows that there wasn't agreement (GDV of 17.5% vs 11% on BTS scheme). Also GVA hadn't reviewed the hybrid BTS/BTR scheme (see letter from GVA a couple of weeks before hearing).

## Misc
- pg 74, para 7.1 => developer reserves right to retain any surplus resulting from injection of grant funding.
