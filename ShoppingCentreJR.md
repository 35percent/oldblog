On [13th April 2018 letter](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!LXcCuPkZXfUd47qX5Tcdtg%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) the Council's independent advisor GVA wrote to the Council stating that it has been asked to comment on the 'fall-back' BTS scheme and says that whilst it hasn't _'modelled an option whereby the West Site is assessed for viability on a standalone basis on a build to sell route' .. 'at this stage we can only comment that, having reviewed the scheme as a whole, a 35% offer on a BTS option is the maximum, reasonable quantum of Affordable Housing as a fall back position if the BTR option does not proceed.'_ 

GVA adds that _'The BTS offer on the West Site would still offer 35% Affordable Quantum. We acknowledge that a BTS alternative falls into a different test in terms of tenure split with policy being 50:50 Social Rent and Shared Ownership.'_ 

GVA concludes that _'We are also advised by London Borough of Southwark that in a BTS scenario for the West Site, the shortfall in social rented housing from the East Site, would need to be made up on the West Site. Whilst the overall quantum would remain at 35 %, the proportion of social rented housing on the West Site would have to reflect the West Site provision plus the East Site shortfall.'_

In summary, not only is there a higher social rented requirement in a BTS scheme on the West Site but it also encompasses the social rented requirement carried over from the East Site scheme.

The [3 July 2018 planning committee report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!HvOs1eG7BYgl0hYZ8SIm5w%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) appears to take into account these issues and assures the planning committee that this will be taking care of by the S106 agreement. Paragraph 365 of the report entitled __'Fall-back position'__ says:

> "The applicant also wishes to retain a fall-back position whereby the west site could be delivered as traditional build-to-sell units. The exception to this would be the social rented units in the mansion blocks which would be delivered in any event. The developer would notify the Council, of the intention to develop the west site as build to sell, and the affordable housing requirement for this would be for 50% social rented and 50% intermediate. Some of the west site’s social rented units would already be secured in the mansion blocks, albeit 38% rather than the 50% requirement, therefore a review mechanism would be required."

This is repeated in paragraph 404 of the officer report:

> "In the event that the West site is delivered as open market for sale the review will need to take into account the policy requirement for a different tenure split of 50:50 social rented and intermediate."

However the S106 agreement's review mechanism fails to take into account the different tenure requirement. The review provisions for the West Site (pages 130-134) restrict any proceeds from uplift in viability to the provision of 'Additional Affordable Housing' defined on page 8 strictly as the provision of London Living Rent not Social Rent:

 in the event of a BTS scheme on the West Site fails to take into account the revised 50/50 split requirement. In fact, 
Given that the East Site is heavily loaded with the more profitable DMR (80% market rent) tenure and.. 

In addition, the viability review mechanism for the BTS scheme assumes different assumptions - a higher overall profit level (15% IRR) for which there is no agreement (the letter from GVA says that they haven't reviewed the BTS scheme) and 17.5% profit on residential GDV which we know that Southwark didn't want to agree (see draft S106 where LBS said 12.5%?).  Plus all of the other assumptions like professional costs set out in the review mechanism - do they accord with what is in the Argus model in appendix 10 or the requirements of the Viability SPD?

The practical implications of this are that Delancey can now opt to deliver a largely BTS scheme having been granted planning consent on a the reduced SR tenure split requirements of a BTR scheme.




1. Inputs/Assumptions not agreed

- EUV
- Profit on GDV
- Application Viability Appraisal relied upon by the FVA is based on 'with grant funding' -> so review mechanisms and prospect of reduced discounted market rents will be affected if grant funding is not allocated.
-
-S106 applies an 'Affordable Housing Cap' (pg 9) and maximum limit to the level of affordable housing provision (See definition 'Affordable Housing Provision' on page 8).

- OR says nothing about an upper limit being applied to the review mechanism, it just says that any uplift identified by the review would have the 'aim of getting closer to a policy compliant level' (405). Elsewhere in the OR, it says that the review will be conducted in accordance with the Development Viability SPD, which itself applies no such upper limit.  
- This upper limit conflicts with Policy 3.12 of the London Plan which says that developments should provide the maximum amount of affordable housing deemed viable.

para 391 says that _"an agreed position has been reached"_ on the FVA. 
para 392 says _"Extensive discussions have taken place in order to arrive at an agreed position in relation to the financial viability of the scheme. Much of this has centred on matters relating to the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) the comparable expression of profit level for a Build to Rent development as opposed to build for sale. Other issues which have been the subject of discussion have been the valuation of the shopping centre itself and construction costs to name but two. "_


pg 132, para 1.1.6 says ungeared IRR of 12% - isn't it supposed to be 11% according to OR?
Para 395 of the OR says that 11% IRR is the target profit.


Para 364 of the OR says _"The affordable housing proposed would also not be evenly distributed across both sites, with the social rented units all being delivered on the west site. The s106 agreement would therefore stipulate that if the development on the west site has not substantially commenced within 10 years of the east site commencing, the land and sum of money sufficient for construction and completion of the social rented units would be transferred to the Council, to deliver the social rented units."_ This implies that the land would be transferred at nil consideration.
However the S106 agreement fails to secure this - see paras 3.5.2 and 3.5.3 (page 118). These give the option to the Council to either take up a 'long leasehold' agreement with the Council building the homes and the developer paying the construction costs or for the Council to be given the 'long leasehold' at 'nil consideration' with the Council paying the construction costs itself but the value of the non-residential space supposedly making up for the construction costs. 

Para 393 of the OR says that a policy compliant scheme is currently estimated to achieve an IRR of 6.5%, _"which will allow for 36% affordable housing but with a tenure mix that has just 50% in the lowest 4 income bands. To increase this affordability to 86% in these income bands, in accordance with emerging policy P4, the IRR would need to increase over time to 10 -12%. The applicant’s position is for this predicted uplift to be secured by a clawback review mechanism in the S106 agreement."_ Further saying that _"Such a review mechanism would need to be both sophisticated and robust to maximise the level of affordable units, in the lower rental bands, that is both reasonable and viable. "_




## Affordable Housing
Page 16 of the planning statement confirms there will be 106,500 sqm of residential floorspace (GIA). Split evenly between the East and West sites.
The [Accommodation Schedule](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!9e1lINlEHTmcLt5vZsm29g%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) shows that just 9,141 (8.6%) of the overall total residential floorspace will be social rented - half of the policy requirement.

*Extract from the Mayor's [final stage 2 report](https://www.docdroid.net/njfeOJz/3654.pdf#page=7) on the application*

- Definitions 'Social rent equivalents' (page 38) => £155 pw for a one-bed flat? conflicts with definition of SR which says calculated according to Rent Standard Guidance - also says linked to CPI +1%. Can't find any further reference to 'social rent equivalents' anywhere else in the agreement.
-
_"The Social Rented units would be operated by a Registered Provider or the Council with standard Social rented terms"_ (para 336)-
_"Traditional Social Rented Housing"_ (para 371)
Para 360 says that previous application offered 'social rent equivalents'.
-
-pg 67, para 8.1 => says that developer shall use 'reasonable endeavours' to secure public funding and that any such funding should be applied 'to the reduction of the maximum income levels for eligible households from £90k to £60k' - for the EAST SITE.
- ditto in relation to the DMR units on the WEST SITE (pg 128, para 12.1)
- Didn't the Mayor claim to have reduced these thresholds (from £90k to £60k) as 
- pg 74, para 7.1 => developer reserves right to retain any surplus resulting from injection of grant funding.
-
- S106 agreement refers to an 'Affordable Housing Cap' (page 9) and also para 2.1 page 132 - which specifies an upper limit of affordable housing provision. This is not mentioned in the OR and is contrary to policy 3.12 of the LP which requires the maximum viable amount of affordable housing.
