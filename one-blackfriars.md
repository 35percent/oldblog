Berkeley Group's __'One Blackfriars'__ is a development of 274 luxury homes in a 50 storey glass tower with a total development value of £700m.

[Planning application documents](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!yEWdLLdNR%2bJj86NpOhjqfw%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) for __One Blackfriars__ claim that the unique design of the building _"is inspired by both the sculptures of Brancussi, Henry Moore and 1950s Finnish glassware design"_. (page 48)

The scheme was originally given planning consent in 2009 which included a public 'sky deck' on the top floors, allowing public access to some of London's best views. However, this was [axed](http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/5776) three years later after the development changed hands. Berkeley claimed that there would be competition with the public sky deck at the Shard and that it would no longer be viable.

There will be no affordable housing on-site or off-site. This was deemed to be unviable according to a viability assessment undertaken by Savills and submitted to Southwark Council. Instead the developer will pay £29m (4% of total value) in a series of staged payments to the council, towards its council house building programme. 

Berkeley's [planning application](/img/oneblackfriarsplanningapplication.pdf) said that there would be a 'public view lounge' on the 32nd floor.

The planning application's [planning statement](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!28pvllAgL%2bwF8rb4Xe8zyw%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) puts forward the viewing lounge as a material consideration that should be offset against other aspects of the development, which don't comply with policy.

The [One Blackfriars planning committee report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!N3XzHN1XX76Wjzxddhd13g%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) explains that the £29m in-lieu payment was lower than the £35m minimum policy requirement, on the grounds that the development will be providing a _"viewing lounge on the 32nd level, which would be made available to the public by prior arrangement"_. (para. 45)

However, the [small print](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!sk%2bEbHwM0x7SbbHfJ%2bPlUg%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) in the planning application documents show that the public viewing lounge won't be so public. It says the viewing lounge will be accessible only to companies, organisations and residents in Southwark's SE1 (riverside) postcode, who will need to book in advance and pay a fee of £50 plus £30 per hour. This is good news for the Council and its corporate events and good news for Council leader Peter John who lives in a neighbouring riverside development, but not much use to the rest of us elsewhere in the borough.

Berkeley's [brochure](/img/oneblackfriarsbrochure.pdf) advertises the 'public viewing lounge' as a private executive lounge.. (page 45)

The [officer's report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!N3XzHN1XX76Wjzxddhd13g%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) for the planning application says that (despite policy requirements for zero parking) the developer initially applied for 70% of the flats at One Blackfriars to have parking. This was negotiated down to 40% (110 parking spaces) but the developer argued that anything lower than this would affect the viability of the scheme and its ability to provide s106 contributions:

The parking spaces in the development are being marketed for £100k a piece.

The development [came under fire](http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/luxury-london-flat-advert-branded-the-creepiest-thing-you-will-ever-see-9966793.html) in January 2015, when its promoters produced a promotional film showing a couple arriving at the development in a private helicopter.
