Planning application [documents](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s38968/Report.pdf) confirm that the Wood Dene estate comprised 323 council homes within two interlocking blocks, of which 7 were council leaseholders. The estate was demolished in 2007.

Wood Dene tenants were promised the right to return to the redeveloped estate and paragraph 19 of [this council report](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/Data/Executive/20030729/Agenda/56%20-%20Disposal%20of%20216-224Underhill%20Road,%20SE22.pdf) confirms that 173 tenants intended to exercise this right.

The [planning report](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s38968/Report.pdf) shows that the replacement development will provide 333 new homes, of which just 54 will be social rented.

It is therefore difficult to see how the Council's promise of a right to return to the estate can be honoured.

Despite being approved in 2013, the development is still under construction and estimated to be completed in 2017.

[Land Registry deeds](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/LRegisterWoodDene.pdf) show that the Council sold the entire Wood Dene site to Notting Hill for just Â£7m.
