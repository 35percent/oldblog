Peckham Town Hall used to serve as Southwark's main Town Hall for all of its meetings and core administrative functions. The Council [sold it](https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/town-halls-residence-students-move-former-southwark-town-hall-peckham/) with [to a Jersey-based developer (Alumno Developments)](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/LR_PeckhamTownHall.pdf) in December 2014.

A week after the sale Southwark [granted planning permission](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s42948/Item%201%20and%202%20report.pdf) for the building's conversion into private flats to be used as student accommodation. The affordable housing quota was waived on the basis of a viability assessment submitted by the developer.

The building is now let as luxury student accommodation where a single room will [set you back](https://www.gold.ac.uk/accommodation/halls/town-hall-camberwell/) circa £200 per week and a studio £300 per week.

## From Peckham to London Bridge
Meanwhile the Council [resolved](http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/6493) to buy the London Bridge office block it had been renting in the interim (from a Guernsey-based developer) for the grand sum of £170m.

Having funded the purchase by borrowing against its own reserves, the Council was then in a strong position to argue that it didn't have the funds to carry out Decent Homes works on the Heygate and Aylesbury estates. In 2015 it [announced](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s59115/Policy%20and%20Resources%20Strategy%20201617%20to%20201819.pdf) that it was cutting £39m from its education and adult care services budget while [closing and selling off a number of care facilities](http://35percent.org/auctions/#selling-southwarks-adult-care-services).
