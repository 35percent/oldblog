## Peckham Town Hall
Peckham Town Hall served as Southwark's civic centre for all its meetings and core administrative functions for nearly half a century. In December 2014, Southwark's Labour administration [sold it](https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/town-halls-residence-students-move-former-southwark-town-hall-peckham/) [to a Jersey-based developer (Alumno Developments)](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/LR_PeckhamTownHall.pdf).

A week after the sale Southwark [granted planning permission](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s42948/Item%201%20and%202%20report.pdf) for the building's conversion into private flats to be used as student accommodation. The affordable housing quota was waived on the basis of a viability assessment submitted by the developer.

The building is now let as luxury student accommodation where a single room will [set you back](https://www.gold.ac.uk/accommodation/halls/town-hall-camberwell/) circa £200 per week and a studio £300 per week.

Bermondsey Town Hall was [sold off](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/LR_bermondseytownhall.pdf) in December 2012 to developers Hollybrook Ltd, for the knock-down price of £4 million.

By 2014, Hollybrook had carved out 41 luxury apartments from the building, each selling for over a million pounds; a promo video gives prospective buyers a guided tour:

Southwark's Town Halls are a concrete record of proud civic administrations and a leagacy of the days of municipal borough councils, when Southwark once had three town halls, in Peckham and Bermondsey as well as Walworth.  It is a sad irony that, despite promises to keep it in public use after being damaged in a fire, Walworth Town Hall now [looks destined](https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/town-hall-plans-unfit-for-purpose-says-heritage-society/) to join its sister Town Halls as private commercial developments.
