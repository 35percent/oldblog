## Peckham Town Hall
Peckham Town Hall used to serve as Southwark's main Town Hall for its core administrative functions. The Council [sold it](https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/town-halls-residence-students-move-former-southwark-town-hall-peckham/) with [to a Jersey-based developer (Alumno Developments)](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/LR_PeckhamTownHall.pdf) in December 2014.

A week after the sale Southwark [granted planning permission](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s42948/Item%201%20and%202%20report.pdf) for the building's conversion into private flats to be used as student accommodation. The affordable housing quota was waived on the basis of a viability assessment submitted by the developer.

## Tooley Street
Meanwhile the Council [resolved](http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/6493) to buy the London Bridge office block it had been renting in the interim (from a Guernsey-based developer) for the grand sum of £170m.

Meanwhile the Council continued to argue that it simply didn't have the funds to continue to maintain the Heygate and Aylesbury estates..
