Southwark Council's shameful response to the government's refusal of its CPO application, is to seek a judicial review of the decision. The decision was taken at Tuesday's Cabinet meeting, which coincidentally received a deputation from [Aylesbury Leaseholders Group](http://halag.wordpress.com) asking for non-binding arbitration on disputed valuations. Southwark reluctantly agreed to this while also making it plain that it is going to continue the demolition programme - around the remaining leaseholders if need be. Southwark was more generous to Notting Hill Housing, approving the allocation of £21m towards demolition and other ongoing costs. As reported in our [last blog post](http://35percent.org/2016-09-18-aylesbury-compulsory-purchase-order-rejected/#notting-hill-gets-cold-feet), Notting Hill had refused to continue progressing the scheme unless the Council agreed to shoulder the ongoing costs. The Cabinet report confirms that the £21m extra funding requirement will come from the Council's Housing Revenue Account and _'recognises that there will be some knock-on impact on other housing investment projects'_i.e. repairs on other council estates. The Cabinet meeting was subsequently disrupted by a half-hour long protest by [Sisters Uncut](sistersuncut.org) demanding council housing for victims of domestic abuse.

More experienced observers who attended the Cabinet meeting, noted some reservations from Cabinet members, Cllr Livingstone in particular, who suggesed that it would be sensible to seek legal counsel before approving what could be a costly and futile legal challenge - a more sensible course of action from the Council’s point of view - which may explain why it has not happened.

Southwark Council appear to be blind to the ramifications and significance of the Secretary of State's refusal to grant the CPO. His grounds were that Southwark has failed in its public sector equality duty towards its elderly black residents, who come from a Black and Minority Ethnic(BME) background. This is a damning indictment of a Labour council by a right-wing Tory minister. 

## Par to the course
This is not the first time that such a decision has been passed on Southwark Council in terms of how it treats local people from black and ethnic minority backgrounds; its treatment of BME shopping centre traders was [damned](http://35percent.org/2015-11-04-southwark-resolves-to-use-cpo-powers-for-shopping-centre-retailers/) by Lord Herman Ouseley in a report/inquiry inititated by Ken Livingstone after complaints from shopping centre traders. It followed a similar judgement](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/apr/06/race.arts) following complaints from entertainment venue owners in Camberwell. More recently Southwark was [slated](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/judge-blasts-southwark-council-for-evicting-sudanese-tenant-and-destroying-his-possessions-9796994.html) by a High Court judge in a Peckham eviction case, to which Southwark responded by claiming](http://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/confusion-surrounds-sudden-resignation-of-labour-councillor/) that the judge was _"clearly wrong"_ and _“the trial itself was unjust”_. Southwark is intransigent - it doesn't seem to earn any lessons. It should accept the Secretary of State's decision, provide a better deal for leaseholders and give serious considerations to their proposals for improving the situation, i.e. like-for-like swaps. 

## Finances
There could be a reason for Southwark's intransigence though; the finances of the scheme rely on keeping compensation levels to a minimum. Southwark Council halved the amount of money it had originally budgeted, shortly before the Area Action Plan was adopted in 20XX

Increasing the current compensation offered to leaseholders by £50k each would result in a further cost of approximately £15m to the scheme.

## demands
We think Southwark Council should accept the Secretary of State's decision and instead stop breaching its residents human and equalities rights. If it is to mount a judicial review on the Secretary of State's decision then it should first make public its legal advice from counsel on the probability of such a challenge being successful. 

Moratorium on its [council estate regeneration programme]. We think that the £52m earmarked for the Aylesbury estate regeneration and the funds being spent on the legal challenge would be better spent building new council homes elsewhere in the borough.

## summary
Net loss of between 72x and 1,166

Net loss of 1.8 Hectares of public open space

## Conclusion

Of course it is not only leaseholders who are being badly treated, but the exposure of this basic flaw - the scheme depends upon shortchanging leaseholders - shows how badly conceived it is and leads to the demand that it be halted.
