Southwark Council's shameful response to the government's refusal of its CPO application for the [Aylesbury estate](http://35percent.org/aylesbury-estate), is to seek a judicial review of the decision. The decision was taken at Tuesday's Cabinet meeting, which coincidentally received a deputation from [Aylesbury Leaseholders Group](http://halag.wordpress.com) asking for non-binding arbitration on disputed valuations. Southwark reluctantly agreed to this while also making it plain that it is going to continue the demolition programme - around the remaining leaseholders if need be. Southwark was more generous to Notting Hill Housing, approving the allocation of £21m towards demolition and other ongoing costs. As reported in our [last blog post](http://35percent.org/2016-09-18-aylesbury-compulsory-purchase-order-rejected/#notting-hill-gets-cold-feet), Notting Hill had refused to continue progressing the scheme unless the Council agreed to shoulder the ongoing costs. The Cabinet report confirms that the £21m extra funding requirement will come from the Council's Housing Revenue Account and _'recognises that there will be some knock-on impact on other housing investment projects'_ - i.e. repairs on other council estates. The Cabinet meeting was subsequently disrupted by a half-hour long protest by [Sisters Uncut](sistersuncut.org) demanding council housing for victims of domestic abuse.

More experienced observers who attended the Cabinet meeting, noted some reservations from Cabinet members, Cllr Livingstone in particular, who suggesed that it would be sensible to seek legal counsel before approving what could be a costly and futile legal challenge - a more sensible course of action from the Council’s point of view - which may explain why it has not happened.

Southwark Council appear to be blind to the ramifications and significance of the Secretary of State's refusal to grant the CPO. His grounds were that Southwark has failed in its public sector equality duty towards its elderly black residents, who come from a Black and Minority Ethnic(BME) background. This is a damning indictment of a Labour council by a right-wing Tory minister. 

## Par to the course
This is not the first time that such a judgement has been passed on Southwark Council in terms of how it treats local people from black and ethnic minority backgrounds; its treatment of BME shopping centre traders was [damned](http://35percent.org/2015-11-04-southwark-resolves-to-use-cpo-powers-for-shopping-centre-retailers/) by Lord Herman Ouseley in a report/inquiry inititated by Ken Livingstone after complaints from shopping centre traders. It followed a [similar judgement](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/apr/06/race.arts) following complaints from entertainment venue owners in Camberwell. More recently Southwark was [slated](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/judge-blasts-southwark-council-for-evicting-sudanese-tenant-and-destroying-his-possessions-9796994.html) by a High Court judge in a Peckham eviction case, to which Southwark responded by [claiming](http://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/confusion-surrounds-sudden-resignation-of-labour-councillor/) that the judge was _"clearly wrong"_ and _“the trial itself was unjust”_. Southwark is intransigent - it doesn't seem to earn any lessons. It should accept the Secretary of State's decision, provide a better deal for leaseholders and give serious considerations to their proposals for improving the situation, i.e. like-for-like swaps. 

## Bridging the gap
There could be a reason for Southwark's intransigence though; the finances of the scheme rely on keeping compensation levels to a minimum. Southwark Council halved the amount of money it had originally budgeted, shortly before the [Area Action Plan](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/downloads/download/4444/area_action_plans) was adopted in 2010.

## The business case for a moratorium 
We call for a moratorium on Southwark's [council estate regeneration programme](http://35percent.org/the-southwark-clearances). The Council has spent a staggering £47m on the Aylesbury regeneration scheme to date and is set to spend a further £52m on it over the next 3 years alone. We think these funds and the money it is spending on the legal challenge to the Secretary of State would be better spent maintaining existing council homes and building new ones elsewhere in the borough.

[Invoices](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/DHS_MajorWorks_Section20Invoice.pdf) issued to leaseholders show that the Council is currently spending £12m on major works bringing 611 homes on the last phase of the estate up to Decent Homes Standard (pro rata cost of £20k per home). Using this as a multiplier, it would cost £30m to bring the remaining 1500 council homes on the Aylesbury up to Decent Homes Standard (£20k X 1500 = £30m).

In April 2016, the Information Commissioner [upheld our complaint](https://ico.org.uk/media/action-weve-taken/decision-notices/2016/1624349/fs_50589692.pdf) and directed Southwark Council to disclose the unredacted viability report. The disclosed [viability assessment](/img/document.pdf) reveals that Notting Hill will make a minimum (guaranteed) 21% profit from the scheme, expected to amount to £163m, while Southwark will receive staged land payments calculated as a residual value once scheme costs and Notting Hill's 21% profit has been deducted[^1]. The assessment shows that this is currently expected to amount to just £51m - less than the Council is spending on the scheme over the next 3 years alone.

Not only is the Council be losing money on the sale of the Aylesbury estate, it is losing much-needed council homes; the Council's own [planning documents](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!Vbu5QpckfYCnJrulzlWyuQ%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) show that it will be losing somewhere between 778 and 1,166 social rented homes as a result of the scheme; and this is assuming all of the replacement social housing won't be switched to affordable rents of up to 80% market rent as Notting Hill has [done elsewhere](http://35percent.org/redefining-social-rent/#bermondsey-spa-site-c5-10ap3010).

## Conclusion
We think Southwark Council should accept the Secretary of State's decision and stop breaching its residents human and equalities rights. If it is to mount a judicial review on the Secretary of State's decision, then it should first make public its legal advice from counsel on the probability of such a challenge being successful. 

Of course it is not only leaseholders who are being badly treated, but the exposure of this basic flaw - the scheme depends upon shortchanging leaseholders - shows how badly conceived it is and leads to the demand that it be halted.
