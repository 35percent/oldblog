Southwark Council's shameful response to the government's refusal of its CPO application, is to seek a judicial review of the decision. The decision was taken at Tuesday's Cabinet meeting, which coincidentally received a deputation from [Aylesbury Leaseholders Group](http://halag.wordpress.com) asking for non-binding arbitration on disputed valuations. Southwark reluctantly agreed to this while also making it plain that it is going to continue the demolition programme - around the remaining leaseholders if need be. Southwark was more generous to Notting Hill Housing, approving the allocation of £21m towards demolition and other ongoing costs. As reported in our [last blog post], Notting Hill had refused to continue funding the scheme unless the money was forthcoming. The Cabinet meeting was disrupted by a half-hour long protest by [Sisters Uncut] demanding council housing for victims of domestic abuse.

Southwark Council appear to be blind to the ramifications and significance of the Secretary of State's refusal to grant the CPO. His grounds were that Southwark has failed in its public sector equality duty towards its elderly black residents, who come from a Black and Minority Ethnic background. This is a damning indictment of a Labour council by a right-wing Tory minister. 

## Par to the course
This is not the first time that such a decision has been passed on Southwark Council in terms of how it treats local people from black and ethnic minority backgrounds; its treatment of BME shopping centre traders was [damned] by Lord Herman Ouseley in a report/inquiry inititated by Ken Livingstone after complainst from shopping centre traders. More recently Southwark was slated by a High Court judge in a Peckham eviction case, to which it. Camberwell night club - Imperial Gardens. Southwark is intransigent - it doesn't seem to earn any lessons. It should accept the Secretary of State's decision, provide a better deal for leaseholders and give serious considerations to their proposals for improving the situation, i.e. like-for-like swaps. 

There might be an explanation for why this isn't happening and why Southwark is behaving so stupidly.

## Finances
There could be a reason for Southwark's intransigence though; the finances of the scheme rely on keeping compensation levels to a minimum. Southwark Council halved the amount of money it had originally budgeted, shortly before the Area Action Plan was adopted in 20XX

a 20% increase in compensation would result in a further £xm cost to the scheme. 

After a significant delay as the result of a protest by [Sisters Uncut], the deputation's one demand of non-binding arbitration for disputed valuations was only reluctantly agreed by members.

## Conclusion

Of course it is not only leaseholders who are being badly treated, but the exposure of this basic flaw - the scheme depends upon shortchanging leaseholders - shows how badly conceived it is and leads to the demand that it be halted.
