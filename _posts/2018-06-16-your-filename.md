  Southwark Law Centre makes big objection to shopping centre planning
  application

## A New Post
## 
Southwark Law Centre(SLC), along with the Elephant Amenity Network and Latin Elephant, have submitted an updated objection to Delancey's planning application, focusing on Southwark's failure to meet its public sector equality duty.  This follows an earlier objection made last Septmeber(link) and takes account of the improvements made to the application by Delancey, after the planning committee voted against approval in January, adjourning the final decision, which has yet to be made.

The equality duty requires all public bodies to consider the impact of their actions and policies on people who are disadvantaged or suffer inequality.  The shopping centre is home to many who fall into these categories, whether they are traders, shoppers or just enjoying the social life.  It is Southwark's responsibility to examine Delancey's application for any disproportionate detrimental impact on 'protected groups'(defined broadly speaking, by age, race and gender), what mitigation is proposed if there is and whether it is sufficient.  If Southwark is not satisfied, the application can be turned down.  Southwark's As  duty is not confined to preventing negative effects, there is also a positive duty to promote equality of opportunity.

The SLC objection is detailed and lengthy and notes several shortcomings - that Southwark has not gathered sufficient evidence to judge the impact of the application; that there is no general analysis of that impact on traders, employees, clients and customers and such analysis as there is, is out of date. The objection also proposes an equalities analysis of the reloction strategy, to test whether it actually helps those who need 



Trader's complaints - escalotor, lack of maintenance, loss of footfall, lack of security - quotes.  In short that Delancey are running the centre down.  Leases

Loss of tunnel - http://35percent.org/shopping-centre/

35% Campaign visited Delancey's consultation unit and asked about the sevicing tunnel that was to join the redeveloped centre with Elephant One, just the other side fo the railway.

Thank you for visiting the Consultation Unit on 4th June within the Shopping Centre at Elephant and Castle. 

I believe you asked a question regarding whether the servicing tunnel, which was envisaged when the S.106 was agreed for the development at 50 New Kent Road in 2008 to serve a future development of the Shopping Centre site, will form part of the proposals for the new Town Centre.

The feasibility of delivering this shared access route from the neighbouring development was explored at length during design development and in consultation with the council and Transport for London (TfL). Initial studies undertaken by the project team confirmed that although the construction of a tunnel beneath the viaduct was technically feasible, the assumed dimensions between the individual Victorian piers of the railway viaduct meant that it would not be sufficiently sized for the delivery vehicles required. 

The council commissioned Balfour Beatty to carry out an independent review of the work carried out by the project team. The Balfour Beatty investigation concluded that the construction would be particularly complicated and require specialist piling and tunnelling machinery as a result of the spatial constraints and risk to the railway infrastructure. If this solution could be agreed with Network Rail, which was considered unlikely, it would have significant cost implications that would compromise the delivery of other aspects of the development such as affordable housing. Numerous other options were proposed and having considered these, Southwark officers and TfL agreed that a new independent access from New Kent Road was the right solution for the new development.

I hope the above has answered your question but please do contact us again if you have any further questions.

Kind regards
The Elephant and Castle Project Team.
