Our previous posts have revealed how a network of companies known as PGP and Trademark Group (all related to Galliard Homes) have been selling and letting affordable housing on the open market. 

We also revealed how Southwark Council is taking high court action to recover some of these homes or compensation for their unlawful use. However, we have discovered several other sites not noted by Southwark where the same seems to be happening.

## Signal Building
The first of these is the 22-storey Signal Building at Elephant & Castle (83-93 Newington Causeway). Planning permission for this development of 38 units (including 11 intermediate rent affordable homes) was given in 2009. Developers Neobrand were granted a variation of the S106 agreement in 2013 to allow the intermediate rent homes to become shared ownership. The housing association involved was LDHA (letting agent: Independent London Ltd; managing agent - Trademark [Kabob]).

## 197 Long Lane (separate blog?)
The [section 106 agreement](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!L4MSErtnZiirsdK2Q9PoAQ%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) shows that the developer of the Long Lane scheme is a company called 'Northcover Ltd', for which Companies House data lists Mr Conway as a director.

Interestingly, 197 Long Lane also happens to be the registered office of Terry McMillan who shares a number of directorships with Mr Conway on the board of many of the companies implicated in the legal proceedings. 197 Long Lane is also recorded in Land Registry documents the registered address for Independent London Ltd (the letting agent implicated in three of the sites for the four 'conspiracies'). 197 Long Lane was also the registered address for Faithland Housing Association, which later changed its name to London District Housing Association. 197 Long Lane is also the registered address for most of the PGP companies, as is 117 Charterhouse St the registered address for the Trademark Group and the registered address for the accountants for many of these companies.
