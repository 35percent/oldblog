In our last blog post we detailed how Up the Elephant and other campaigners had written to the University of the Arts, London (UAL), informing them that at least 28 traders had not been relocated new premises, as they face the closure of their businesses, to make way for the demolition and redevelopment of the shopping centre. Analysis by Latin Elephant puts the number of traders in peril at nearer fifty.

All the displaced traders (bar one) come from black and ethnic minority backgrounds and the campaigner's letter demanded that UAL withdraw from the redevelopment, which includes a new UAL campus, in line with its 'Black Lives Matter statement _“We aim to build our anti-racism commitments through collective engagement into actions that make a meaningful difference.”_
