As residents of the Heygate estate discovered, early [regeneration promises](http://heygatewashome.org/displacement.html) made to those [pushed aside](http://35percent.org/2013-06-08-the-heygate-diaspora/) are [seldom fulfilled](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-london-housing-idUSKCN0SD0OV20151019), but the scale of the unfulfilled committments made by Southwark to the independant small traders at the Elephant & Castle puts  its duplicity on the Heygate into the shade.
The committments were made in a Business Continuity Charter, drawn up and [recommended to Southwark's Executive Committee in 2007](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/Data/Overview%20&%20Scrutiny%20Committee/20070709/Agenda/Attachment%202.pdf).

The Charter gives a range of undertakings, designed to maintain small traders through the whole development process. The centre was to be maintained as an  _'attractive environment for customers'_ and service charges were to be kept at the lowest possible level, with a cap or freeze on rents.  There would be funding for independent legal advice on leases and tenancy matters and early release from tenancies, should it be needed.  A compensation mechanism for _'adverse impacts of the regeneration'_ would be sought and when the time came for moving, traders would get first refusal for both Southwark's commercial retail units and those secured via section 106 agreements with its other development partners.  Affordable retail units at discounted rents for would be availabl.  The report which presents the Charter even floats the idea of building new premises for displaced traders.

The Charter is an altogether impressive attempt to help the traders and is referred to  in the Council's planning policy framework for the Elephant & Castle regeneration, along with details of the rent subsidies.

However, Lendlease didn't provide any affordable retail at the subsidies agreed in the Charter.

We need to remind our Cabinet member for Regeneration of his promises to traders, which up until less than a year ago vowed to include them in the regeneration plans:

No favours for Delancey

Southwark would no doubt argue that this was all a long time ago and anyhow, it just could not afford any of these measures anymore. The answers are simple - first, regenerations are long-term projects and Southwark needs to repair its shredded credibility after the Heygate debacle, by honouring the undertakings made in the charter;second,the cost must be met by Delancey, through the S106 agreement that follows any approved planning application.  S106 agreements are specifically aimed to mitigate the adverse effects of the new developments and there can no goup more adeversely effected than the independent traders.

Southwark's [development plan](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/assets/attach/1817/1.0.5%20Elephant%20%26%20Castle%20SPD%20OAPF.pdf) for the Elephant and Castle was adopted in 2012 after five years of consultation with stakeholders and the local community. This included the Elephant & Castle shopping centre traders who had successfully lobbied the Council for a Charter, which set out the principles by which they would be provided for and included within the redevelopment scheme.



as that which had been agreed for the 'Volvo site' i.e. Delancey's __Elephant One__
