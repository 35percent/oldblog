As we saw with the Heygate estate, early [regeneration promises](http://heygatewashome.org/displacement.html) made to those pushed aside are seldom fulfilled and the [consequences](http://35percent.org/2013-06-08-the-heygate-diaspora/) have been [widely documented](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-london-housing-idUSKCN0SD0OV20151019). 

Southwark's [development plan](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/assets/attach/1817/1.0.5%20Elephant%20%26%20Castle%20SPD%20OAPF.pdf) for the Elephant and Castle was adopted in 2012 after five years of consultation with stakeholders and the local community. This included the Elephant & Castle shopping centre traders who had successfully lobbied the Council for a Charter, which set out the principles by which they would be provided for and included within the redevelopment scheme. 

The Charter was drawn up and [approved by Southwark's Executive Committee in 2007](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/Data/Overview%20&%20Scrutiny%20Committee/20070709/Agenda/Attachment%202.pdf).

It gave explicit details of the rent discount that would be applied to support the traders' transition as that which had been agreed for the 'Volvo site' i.e. Delancey's __Elephant One__. This set out rent subsidies of approx 40% of market rent for the first five years.

The Charter was referenced in the Council's final planning policy framework for the Elephant & Castle along with details of the rent subsidies.
