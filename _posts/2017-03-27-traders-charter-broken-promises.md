As residents of the Heygate estate discovered, early [regeneration promises](http://heygatewashome.org/displacement.html) made to those [pushed aside](http://35percent.org/2013-06-08-the-heygate-diaspora/) are [seldom kept](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-london-housing-idUSKCN0SD0OV20151019), but the scale of the unfulfilled committments made by Southwark to the independant small traders at the Elephant & Castle shopping centre puts the Heygate into the shade.
The committments are made in a Business Continuity Charter, drawn up and [recommended to Southwark's Executive Committee in 2007](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/Data/Overview%20&%20Scrutiny%20Committee/20070709/Agenda/Attachment%202.pdf). (NB The [Executive](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/Data/Executive/20070130/Agenda/Executive%20Minutes%2030%20January%202007.pdf) included Cllr Kim Humphreys, though he was absent from the 2007 meeting. Cllr Humphreys is now plain Kim Humphreys, founder of [Carvil Ventures](http://carvil-ventures.co.uk/about-us) who are [_'providing public affairs services'_ ](http://carvil-ventures.co.uk/case-studies) to shopping centre developer Delancey).

**Charter aid**

The Charter gives a range of undertakings, designed to maintain small traders through the whole redevelopment process. The centre is to be maintained as an  _'attractive environment for customers'_ and service charges to be kept at the lowest possible level, with a cap or freeze on rents.  There will be funding for independent legal advice on leases and tenancy matters and early release from tenancies, should that be needed.  A compensation mechanism for _'adverse impacts of the regeneration'_ will be sought and when the time comes for moving, traders would get first refusal for both Southwark's commercial retail units and those secured via section 106 agreements with its other development partners.  Affordable retail units at discounted rents will be available.  The report which presented the Charter even floats the idea of building new premises for displaced traders.

The Charter is a creditable attempt to help the traders and appears in the Council's 2012 planning policy framework for the Elephant & Castle regeneration of 2012, along with details of the rent subsidies.

But this is Southwark and so we cannot be surprised that, in fact, none of the the committments in the Charter have been fulfilled - no legal help, no compensation mechanism, no rent freeze, only rising service charges.

**Big boys first**

We have detailed [elsewhere](http://35percent.org/tribeca-square/) how Sainsburys barged small traders aside, denying them the most desirable location on Delancey's Elephant One development, and how another prospective location, the Market Square has [lost its market](http://35percent.org/tribeca-square/).  Delancey also took the opportunity, while putting out the welcome mat for Sainsbury, to remove the option of preferential consideration for a free market unit from centre traders (image).  

Indeed it is hard to see how Delancey could make its distaste for the traders any clearer, short of taking out an advert in Southwark News.  The 9 units of affordable retail that remain in Elephant One and which should have been given to traders 15 months [before the scheme was completed](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?casereference=13/AP/2302&system=DC) remain empty.   Delancey's disdains to provide any affordable retail in shopping centre application and [thumbs its nose](http://35percent.org/2016-12-19-delancey-submits-shopping-centre-application/) at any relocation strategy.

At a trader's meeting last week Southwark said that there will be affordable units in Elephant One (but only 7) and that they have taken issue with Delancey about the lack of any affordable retail or a relocation strategy.  But Delancey are playing Southwark for fools and will be all the more encouraged having seen themselves eulogised in _Southwark Life_, the Council magazine, for its role at the Elephant and as Southwark's development partner.

**Ten years after**

Southwark is to consider how to support traders at a Cabinet meeting on 9 May -  10 years, 4 months and 9 days after it considered the Charter.  There is only one thing that an honest and decent Council would do at that meeting and## Southwark needs to repair its shredded credibility after the Heygate debacle.  Southwark must honour the undertakings made in the Charter, with the cost met by Delancey through an S106 agreement. If Delancey does not do this (and also include 50% social rented housing in its affordable housing offer) Southwark must refuse its planning application.

END



However, Lendlease didn't provide any affordable retail at the subsidies agreed in the Charter.

We need to remind our Cabinet member for Regeneration of his promises to traders, which up until less than a year ago vowed to include them in the regeneration plans:

No favours for Delancey

Southwark's [development plan](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/assets/attach/1817/1.0.5%20Elephant%20%26%20Castle%20SPD%20OAPF.pdf) for the Elephant and Castle was adopted in 2012 after five years of consultation with stakeholders and the local community. This included the Elephant & Castle shopping centre traders who had successfully lobbied the Council for a Charter, which set out the principles by which they would be provided for and included within the redevelopment scheme.



as that which had been agreed for the 'Volvo site' i.e. Delancey's __Elephant One__
