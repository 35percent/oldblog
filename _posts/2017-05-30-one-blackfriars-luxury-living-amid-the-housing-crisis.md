Anyone troubled by the housing crisis can take comfort from **One Blackfriars**. Looming over the Thames like a wonky ice lolly, Berkeley Group's 50 storey glass tower will have 274 luxury homes, a 110-space multi-level car parking basement, a 152 room hotel, a gym, cinema, wine cellar. massage parlour, swimming pool and much else.

[Planning application documents](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!yEWdLLdNR%2bJj86NpOhjqfw%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) for __One Blackfriars__ claim that the fatuous design of the building _"is inspired by both the sculptures of Brancussi, Henry Moore and 1950s Finnish glassware design"_ and the arty pretentions continue with interiors ['inspired'](https://www.berkeleygroup.co.uk/new-homes/london/southwark/one-blackfriars) by Thomas Gainsborough, JMW Turner and Barbara Hepworth.

The scheme was originally given planning consent in 2009, and to include a public 'sky deck' on the top floors, giving public access to some of London's best views, but this was [axed](http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/5776) three years later, after Berkeley group purchased the site and claimed that competition from the Shard's sky deck would render One Blackfriar's sky deck unviable.

As consolation for the loss, Berkeley's [planning application](http://35percent.org/img/oneblackfriarsplanningapplication.pdf) proposed a _'public viewing lounge on level 32'_.

*Extract from Berkeley's [planning application](http://35percent.org/img/oneblackfriarsplanningapplication.pdf)*

The [planning application statement](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!28pvllAgL%2bwF8rb4Xe8zyw%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) puts forward the viewing lounge as a material consideration that should be offset against other aspects of the development, which don't comply with policy.

Car parking was one area of non-compliance.  Despite the site having the highest level of transport accessibility and a policy requirement to minimises car use, Southwark was persuaded that Berkeley simply would not be able to sell the apartments at 'viable' prices without a three storey 110 space basement car-park, complete with car stacker and valet service.

Inevitably, affordable housing was also non-compliant.  There will be no affordable housing on-site or off-site.  Instead Berkeley are making a payment towards Southwark's [floundering council home delivery programme](https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/council-admits-will-miss-target-build-1500-new-council-homes-2018/), but after paying to build a [snow cabin](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/dec/28/snow-cabins-jungle-showers-latest-perks-luxury-london-flat) and ice fountain, a ['gym with private Zen garden'](https://www.berkeleygroup.co.uk/new-homes/london/southwark/one-blackfriars), a virtual golf course with whisky bar, a swimming pool, a sauna with jungle shower, a wine cellar with tasting room, a hot stone massage parlour and a cinema, Berkeley found it did not have enough money to meet the full in lieu payment of £35m, so offered £29m instead - 4% of an estimated total scheme value of £700m - which Southwark gratefully accepted.  Penthouses at __One Blackfriars__ are [currently on sale](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/buy/one-blackfriars-an-exclusive-look-inside-the-vase-londons-newest/) for £23m.

This was all justified by a viability assessment, drafted by Savills for Berkeley and submitted to Southwark.  Southwark disclosed [the viability assessment](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/226757/response/575472/attach/2/141022%20part%201%20attachment%201.pdf) to a local resident, in response to an FOI request, but with all the figures redacted.  We therefore have to rely on the [One Blackfriars planning committee report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!N3XzHN1XX76Wjzxddhd13g%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) to explain why the £29m in lieu payment was lower than the £35m minimum policy requirement.

*Extract from the (completely) redacted [viability assessment](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/226757/response/575472/attach/2/141022%20part%201%20attachment%201.pdf).* 

While the report depends upon the viability assessment to justify the loss of money to the council, it does not relay to the planning committe any of the critical value assumptions needed to judge its veracity, such as profit rate, land value and benchmark value.  Instead it cites the high build cost of the tower's _'distinctive...curved glass facade'_ (which it thought to be _'not necessarily unreasonable'_) and the _'notable benefit'_ to the scheme of the aforementioned public viewing lounge, which, while costing Berkeley £5.5m, _'would be available to the community at a low charge'_ (para 149,150).

Leaving aside whatever sense sacrificing homes for viewing lounges makes, the [small print](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!sk%2bEbHwM0x7SbbHfJ%2bPlUg%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) in the planning application documents show that the public viewing lounge won't be so public. It will only be accessible to companies, organisations and residents in Southwark's SE1 (riverside) postcode, who will need to book in advance and pay a fee of £50 plus £30 per hour.  Berkeley's most recent [brochure](http://35percent.org/img/oneblackfriarsbrochure.pdf) for __One Blackfriars__ is now advertising the public viewing lounge as a _'private executive lounge'_, and an _'exclusive private club'_ for residents (page 45) and a comparison of the image presented to the planning committee and the image in the latest brochure shows the difference.  Berkeley's brochures for __One Blackfriars__ can be downloaded in [Russian](http://35percent.org/img/obrussian.pdf), [Chinese](http://35percent.org/img/obchinese.pdf) and [Arabic](http://35percent.org/img/obarabic.pdf).

## Revolving doors

If you are wondering how Berkeley manage to run such finely-managed rings around Southwark's planning office, the answer is that they are well advised. Berkeley employed [Four Communications](http://fourcommunications.com) to help with its planning application. Four Communications is [founded and run](http://35percent.org/2014-10-19-gamekeepers-turned-poachers/) by former Southwark (Labour) Council leader Jeremy Fraser and employs Southwark's former (Labour) Cabinet member for Regeneration, Steve Lancashire. Berkeley also employed Southwark's former Lib/Dem Cabinet member for Regeneration Catherine Bowman before she [set up shop](http://carvil-ventures.co.uk) with former Tory deputy leader Kim Humphries. Yet another example of Southwark's well-oiled and well-used [revolving door](http://35percent.org/revolving-doors) between the Council and the development industry.

## Crass marketing

The development [came under fire](http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/luxury-london-flat-advert-branded-the-creepiest-thing-you-will-ever-see-9966793.html) in January 2015, when its promoters produced a [bizzare promotional film](http://uk.businessinsider.com/bizarre-one-blackfriars-ad-from-new-homes-london-2015-1) showing a macho city type taking his wife househunting in a helicopter and being served by a butler in their luxury __One Blackfriars__ apartment.
