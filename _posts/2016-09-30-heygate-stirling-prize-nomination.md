The first completed phase of the Heygate regeneration has been nominated for the Sterling Prize architecture award.

Follows on from last year's nomination of [Neo Bankside](http://35percent.org/neo-bankside), which also [failed](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2015/jul/21/neo-bankside-how-richard-rogers-new-non-dom-accom-cut-out-the-poor) to provide the affordable housing originally promised.


Bla bla - astonishing that this development is nominated for a design award when it's built on the grave of Heygate, with primarily luxury private housing and the public realm locked away with no public access in a raised courtyard above a huge parking lot.

## Environmental, Social and economic well-being test

Paul Palley's paragraph from the Inspector's report where she says the scheme won't have beneficial social, environmental and economic impact.

> "I conclude that the CPO would not fully achieve the social, economic and environmental well-being sought. In reaching this view I have had regard to the fact that planning permission has been granted for the redevelopment of the Order Lands." (para 377)
