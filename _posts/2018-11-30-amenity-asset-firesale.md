Four of the five phases on the outline site have been granted permission to date:

## MP1
[13/AP/3581, 3582, 3583, 3584](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s43900/Report%20Heygate%20estate.pdf) = 360 (17 SR)

## MP2
[14/AP/3438, 3439](http://moderngov.southwarksites.com/documents/s50289/Report.pdf) = 593 (26 SR)

## MP3 
[17/AP/2269](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!oJG0OnMvKZ4VsGSwYqmSVw%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) (H5) = 384 (9 SR)
[17/AP/0693](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!i2RLygvpX9P53u8MAzawQw%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) (H4) = 445 (17 SR)

## MP4
[18/AP/1862, 1863](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!sXiQsUWbHm%2bPCMstICWiQw%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) 481 (8 SR)

__Total: 2263 homes of which 77 Social Rent__

Lendlease's schedule at outline stage shows that both MP3 and MP4 have provided nearly twice as many homes as envisaged (ignore red circle):

Note that both MP3 and MP4 decisions which transgressed the outline specification were delegated.

The outline application's development specification granted permission for: _"Redevelopment to provide a mixed use development comprising a number of buildings ranging between 13.13m (AOD) and 104.8m (AOD) in height with capacity for between 2,300 (min) and 2,469 (max) residential units"_

So if MP5 is to comply with the outline application then it can only provide max 206 homes. No wonder then that LL wanted to vary the development specification..

Note that the planning committee reports don't provide details of residential floorspace so it's impossible to determine whether this will be exceeded.
