We [reported previously] on Southwark's ongoing sale and demolition of its council homes. This week we take a look at other assets that its (Labour) administration has sold off over the past 8 years. 

Besides flogging off its [Town Halls](http://35percent.org/southwark-town-halls/) and having a [policy](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s19458/Report%20Review%20of%20Void%20Disposal%20Strategy.pdf) of [selling council homes at auction](http://35percent.org/img/sold_by_southwark.pdf) when they become vacant, Southwark has also been selling of its care homes and homeless hostels.
