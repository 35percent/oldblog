Southwark Council's planning committee is [set to approve](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!XG78U8hptdA1Wd%2brEpqcTA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) the [largest planning application](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?casereference=18/AP/1604&system=DC) ever submitted in the borough by the end of the month, when it considers the redevelopment of Canada Water. This huge 21 hectare site includes the Canada Water shopping Centre, the old Daily Mail printworks and the Surrey Quays leisure park.  Developer British Land (BL) proposals for about 7 million sq ft of development will be considered over two planning meetings on the 25 and 30 September.

The masterplan site is the final phase and main component of the [Council's regeneration of Canada Water](http://35percent.org/canada-water) and comprises a cluster of tall buildings up to 34 storeys, with a mix of residential, retail, office, workspace and leisure uses.  It will include a hotel, student accommodation, cinema and community facilities.

The planning application is in two parts, the first part an outline application for between 2,000 and 4,000 new homes, the second, much smaller part, a detailed proposal for 265 new homes, across three plots, plus a petrol filing station on a fourth.

Apart from its size the Canada Water application is notable in other respects.

Southwark Council is the freehold owner of the Print Works and the Surrey Quays shopping centre (for which it collects £400k p.a. in rent and 5% of turnover respectively[^1]) and has a 20% interest in the site's development of the site under a  Master Development Agreement (MDA) with BL.



## Affordable Housing
The scheme is proposing a maximum of 4,260 homes, 35% of which would be affordable. However, the Mayor's London Plan requires 50% affordable housing on public and former industrial land. It also requires a viability review mechanism to ensure that if the scheme turns out to be more viable than predicted then extra affordable housing will be provided - up to the 50% requirement.

Southwark is proposing to breach this policy requirement by discounting profit from the commercial elements of the viability review of the scheme (office space, retail etc) and by lowering the review's affordable housing requirement to 40%. 

It justifies this departure from policy requirements on the basis of the 'risk' that British Land's commitment to provide 35% affordable, _"given the current day viability position."_

Frankly, we find it difficult to understand why Southwark is recommendeding this departure from the Mayor's policy. Its purpose is precisely to ensure an uplift in affordable housing should it turn out that viability positions at planning stage have been overly pessimistic. We say the scheme should comply with the Mayor's 50% policy requirement for the viability review. This would provide circa 420 extra much-needed affordable homes.

Finding space for new affordable homes is becoming increasingly difficult. The more affordable housing provided on this site, the less the Council will need to buy land off developers to build new Council homes. Last week it [approved the purchase](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s84621/Report%20593%20Old%20Kent%20Road%20acquisition%20of%20site%20to%20deliver%20new%20Council%20housing.pdf) of its fifth site in the neighbouring Old Kent Rd area in the last two years alone[^2].

## The contractual agreement
It's important to remember that Southwark Council is British Land's development partner in this scheme. There is a lengthy and detailed [contractual agreement](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/regeneration/canada-water?chapter=6) between the parties that was signed over a year ago. 

Unfortunately, the [Affordable housing section](https://docdro.id/LfnPTM2) of the partnership agreement between Southwark and development partner British Land has been completely redacted.

We request that an unredacted version of this is provided to the committee.

## Replacement leisure centre
The planning committee report makes much of the brand new leisure centre that will be provided as part of the scheme. What it doesn't emphasise is that the existing Seven Islands leisure centre will be demolished and the replacement centre will have a smaller swimming pool. Neither does it mention that the Council will be funding the construction of the new leisure centre (up to a cap of £35m).

## Retailers booted out
Sounds familiar (E&C shopping centre).
Tesco has [objected](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!mfBPS4FpNyvJIYiLezGjrA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) to the planning application, arguing that the planning committee report misrepresents its current position.

## A little history - British Land
British Land is Southwark's development partner for the scheme and is one of the UK’s largest developers. It is formerly run but still partly owned by property magnate Sir John Ritblat, father of Delancey’s Jamie Ritblat (see [E&C redevelopment](http://35percent.org/shopping-centre) and its [offshore connections](http://35percent.org/2014-05-05-manx-connections-the-off-shore-home-of-the-elephants-developers/)). The Ritblats are one of the Tory party's top 100 donors.

Both Delancey and British Land were named in the Panama Papers leaks for their [relationship to a network of offshore subsidiaries/parent companies](https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/nodes/80061680).

## Conclusion
It's bad enough that Southwark has done a deal to redevelop 21 hectares of its land with a Tory-donating tax-avoiding company. The least it should do is comply with the Mayor's minimum affordable housing/viability review requirements.
