Southwark Council's planning committee is set to approve the largest planning application ever submitted in the borough next week. 

The Canada Water masterplan site is the final and largest scheme in the [Council's regeneration of Canada Water](http://35percent.org/canada-water).

## A little history
This huge site comprising approx 7 million sqft of development across 46 acres comprises the Canada Water shopping Centre, the old Daily Mail printworks and the Surrey Quays leisure park.

The Council is the freehold owner of the Print Works and the shopping centre for which it collects £400k rent and 5% of turnover respectively[^1].

## British Land
British Land is one of the UK’s largest developers. It is formerly run but still partly owned by property magnate Sir John Ritblatt (father of Delancey’s Jamie Ritblatt) and long-standing Tory party donor.

## Affordable Housing

[Affordable housing section](https://docdro.id/LfnPTM2) of the contractual agreement between Southwark and development partner British Land has been completely redacted.

We request that an unredacted version of this is provided to the committee.

Were the scheme to comply with the 50% requirement then it would provide up to an extra xxx affordable homes.

## Meanwhile buying land
Meanwhile the Council is continuing its buying spree of buying land off developers in order to build new Council homes. 
Last week it [approved the purchase](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s84621/Report%20593%20Old%20Kent%20Road%20acquisition%20of%20site%20to%20deliver%20new%20Council%20housing.pdf) of its fifth site in the neighbouring Old Kent Rd area[^2].
