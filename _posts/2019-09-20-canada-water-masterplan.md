Southwark Council's planning committee is [set to approve](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!XG78U8hptdA1Wd%2brEpqcTA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) the [largest planning application](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?casereference=18/AP/1604&system=DC) ever submitted in the borough by the end of the month, when it considers the redevelopment of Canada Water. This huge 21 hectare site includes the Surrrey Quays shopping centre and leisure park and the old Daily Mail printworks.  Developer British Land's (BL) proposals for about 7 million sq ft of development will be considered over two planning meetings on the 25 and 30 September.

The masterplan site is the final phase and main component of the [Council's regeneration of Canada Water](http://35percent.org/canada-water) and comprises a cluster of tall buildings up to 34 storeys, with a mix of residential, retail, office, workspace and leisure uses.  It will include a hotel, student accommodation, cinema and community facilities.

The planning application is in two parts.  The first part is an outline application for between 2,000 and 4,000 new homes, with other non-residential uses, while the second, much smaller part, is a detailed proposal for 265 new homes,a leisure centre (a replacement for the Seven Islands centre), plus a petrol filling station on a fourth.

## The Affordable Housing

The proposed scheme is for a minimum of 2,000 new homes, rising to a possible 4,000 maximum, 35% of which would be affordable (25% social rent, 10% intermediate housing). This is in line with Southwark's own local plan. 

As well as the local plan requirement, the Mayor's London Plan requires a viability review mechanism, to ensure that if a scheme turns out to be more profitable than predicted, then extra affordable housing can be provided, up to a cap of 50%. Canada Water has to be reviewed because at least a quarter of the site is either public or industrial land.  This, according to the Mayor, makes the threshold for Canada Water review 39%, by virtue of the Printworks being industrial land and Rotherhithe Police Station being public land.

Southwark has compromised with BL on the review mechanism, in breach of housing policy.  It is allowing a 40% cap on any increase in affordable housing, instead of 50%, as well as allowing BL to discount any profit from the commercial elements (office space, retail etc) of  the scheme from any viability review. 

Southwark justifies this departure from policy requirements on viability grounds.  It agrees with BL that the scheme can only viably support 11% affordable housing and thus BL is incurring a 'risk' by committing to 35%  _"given the current day viability position."_ This is a familiar line of argument, recently deployed by developers of major Old Kent Rd schemes, where the developer says a scheme is unviable, agrees nonetheless to provide 35% affordable housing, but only if there is no review or conditions are placed on the review.  The true profitability of the scheme is therefore never established.

It is difficult to understand why Southwark agrees to undermine reviews with these compromises.  If the review shows that no extra profit is made, then the developer does not have to provide the extra affordable housing.  If, on the other hand, the review shows enough profit is made to provide 50% affordable housing, then it makes no sense to cap it at 40%.  The cap should be restored to 50% and the profit of the whole scheme, not just the residential element, should be measured - it could give us around 400 extra much-needed affordable homes,if the scheme is built to its maximum extent.

Other factors reinforce the argument for not settling for just 35% affordable housing. BL are receiving a total of £39.1m of public money from the Mayor for Canada Water.  If the Mayor gives grants to developers without ensuring the maximum amounts of affordable housing is secured, then it simply becomes a subsidy for developers.

While the Mayor considers that only the Rotherhithe Police Station is public land, Southwark is in fact the freeholder of the Print Works and the Surrey Quays shopping centre (for which it collects £400k p.a. in rent and 5% of turnover respectively[^1]), as well as being BL's development partner, with a 20% interest in the site's development, under a Master Development Agreement (MDA).

Finding space for new affordable homes is also becoming increasingly difficult. Last week Southwark [approved the purchase](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s84621/Report%20593%20Old%20Kent%20Road%20acquisition%20of%20site%20to%20deliver%20new%20Council%20housing.pdf) of its fifth site in the neighbouring Old Kent Rd area in the last two years alone[^2].

It would therefore be reasonable to expect that maximising affordable housing on the largest development site in the borough would be Southwark's top priority on Canada Water, the largest of many large development sites in the borough and not just settling for the minimum its housing policy requires. 

## A little history - British Land
British Land is Southwark's development partner for the scheme and is one of the UK’s largest developers. It is formerly run but still partly owned by property magnate Sir John Ritblat, father of Delancey’s Jamie Ritblat (see [E&C redevelopment](http://35percent.org/shopping-centre) and its [offshore connections](http://35percent.org/2014-05-05-manx-connections-the-off-shore-home-of-the-elephants-developers/)). The Ritblats are one of the Tory party's top 100 donors.

Both Delancey and British Land were named in the Panama Papers leaks for their [relationship to a network of offshore subsidiaries/parent companies](https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/nodes/80061680).
