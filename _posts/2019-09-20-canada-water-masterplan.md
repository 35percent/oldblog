Southwark Council's planning committee is [set to approve](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!XG78U8hptdA1Wd%2brEpqcTA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) the [largest planning application](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?casereference=18/AP/1604&system=DC) ever submitted in the borough next week. 

The masterplan site is the final phase and main component of the [Council's regeneration of Canada Water](http://35percent.org/canada-water) and comprises a cluster of tall buildings up to 34 storeys.

## A little history
This huge site comprising approx 7 million sqft of development across 21 hectares, comprises the Canada Water shopping Centre, the old Daily Mail printworks and the Surrey Quays leisure park.

The Council is the freehold owner of the Print Works and the shopping centre for which it collects £400k rent and 5% of turnover respectively[^1].

## British Land
British Land is one of the UK’s largest developers. It is formerly run but still partly owned by property magnate Sir John Ritblatt (father of Delancey’s Jamie Ritblatt) and long-standing Tory party donor.

## Affordable Housing
The scheme is proposing a maximum of 4,260 homes, 35% of which would be affordable. However, the Mayor's London Plan requires 50% affordable housing on public and former industrial land. It also requires a viability review mechanism to ensure that if the scheme turns out to be more viable than predicted then extra affordable housing will be provided - up to the 50% requirement.

Southwark is proposing to breach this policy requirement by discounting the commercial elements of the scheme (office space, retail etc) and by lowering the cap to 40%. 

It justifies this departure from policy requirements on the basis of the 'risk' that British Land's commitment to provide 35% affordable, _"given the current day viability position."_

Were the scheme to comply with the 50% requirement following the viability review then it would provide up to an extra xxx affordable homes.

## The contractual agreement
It's important to remember that Southwark Council is British Land's development partner in this scheme. There is a lengthy and detailed [contractual agreement](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/regeneration/canada-water?chapter=6) between the parties that was signed over a year ago. 

Unfortunately, the [Affordable housing section](https://docdro.id/LfnPTM2) of the contractual agreement between Southwark and development partner British Land has been completely redacted.

We request that an unredacted version of this is provided to the committee.

## Meanwhile buying land
Meanwhile the Council is continuing its buying spree of buying land off developers in order to build new Council homes. 
Last week it [approved the purchase](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s84621/Report%20593%20Old%20Kent%20Road%20acquisition%20of%20site%20to%20deliver%20new%20Council%20housing.pdf) of its fifth site in the neighbouring Old Kent Rd area[^2].

## Replacement leisure centre
The existing Seven Islands leisure centre will be demolished and a new leisure centre built as part of the scheme, albeit with a smaller swimming pool. The Council will be funding the construction of this (up to a cap of £35m).
