Southwark Council's planning committee is set to approve the largest planning application ever submitted in the borough next week. 

The Canada Water masterplan site is the final and largest scheme in the [Council's regeneration of Canada Water](http://35percent.org/canada-water).

## A little history
This huge site comprising approx 7 million sqft of development across 46 acres comprises the Canada Water shopping Centre, the old Daily Mail printworks and the Surrey Quays leisure park.

## British Land
British Land is one of the UK’s largest developers. It is formerly run but still partly owned by property magnate Sir John Ritblatt (father of Delancey’s Jamie Ritblatt) and long-standing Tory party donor.
