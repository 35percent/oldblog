Southwark Council's planning committee is [set to approve](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!XG78U8hptdA1Wd%2brEpqcTA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) the [largest planning application](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?casereference=18/AP/1604&system=DC) ever submitted in the borough next week. 

The masterplan site is the final phase and main component of the [Council's regeneration of Canada Water](http://35percent.org/canada-water) and comprises a cluster of tall buildings up to 34 storeys.

## A little history
This huge site comprising approx 7 million sqft of development across 21 hectares, comprises the Canada Water shopping Centre, the old Daily Mail printworks and the Surrey Quays leisure park.

The Council is the freehold owner of the Print Works and the shopping centre for which it collects £400k rent and 5% of turnover respectively[^1].

## British Land
British Land is one of the UK’s largest developers. It is formerly run but still partly owned by property magnate Sir John Ritblatt (father of Delancey’s Jamie Ritblatt) and one of the Tory party's top 100 donors.

It was named in the Panama Papers leaks for its [relationship to a network of offshore subsidiaries/parent companies](https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/nodes/80061680).

## Affordable Housing
The scheme is proposing a maximum of 4,260 homes, 35% of which would be affordable. However, the Mayor's London Plan requires 50% affordable housing on public and former industrial land. It also requires a viability review mechanism to ensure that if the scheme turns out to be more viable than predicted then extra affordable housing will be provided - up to the 50% requirement.

Southwark is proposing to breach this policy requirement by discounting the commercial elements of the scheme (office space, retail etc) and by lowering the cap to 40%. 

It justifies this departure from policy requirements on the basis of the 'risk' that British Land's commitment to provide 35% affordable, _"given the current day viability position."_

Frankly, we find it difficult to understand why Southwark is recommendeding this departure from the Mayor's policy. Its purpose is precisely to ensure an uplift in affordable housing should it turn out that viability positions at planning stage have been overly pessimistic. We say the scheme should comply with the Mayor's 50% policy requirement for the viability review. This would provide circa 420 extra much-needed affordable homes.

Finding space for new affordable homes is becoming increasingly difficult. The more affordable housing provided on this site, the less the Council will need to buy land off developers to build new Council homes. Last week it [approved the purchase](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s84621/Report%20593%20Old%20Kent%20Road%20acquisition%20of%20site%20to%20deliver%20new%20Council%20housing.pdf) of its fifth site in the neighbouring Old Kent Rd area[^2] in the last two years alone.

## The contractual agreement
It's important to remember that Southwark Council is British Land's development partner in this scheme. There is a lengthy and detailed [contractual agreement](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/regeneration/canada-water?chapter=6) between the parties that was signed over a year ago. 

Unfortunately, the [Affordable housing section](https://docdro.id/LfnPTM2) of the partnership agreement between Southwark and development partner British Land has been completely redacted.

We request that an unredacted version of this is provided to the committee.

## Replacement leisure centre
The planning committee report makes much of the brand new leisure centre that will be provided as part of the scheme. What it doesn't emphasise is that the existing Seven Islands leisure centre will be demolished and the replacement centre will have a smaller swimming pool. Neither does it mention that the Council will be funding the construction of the new leisure centre (up to a cap of £35m).

## Conclusion
It's bad enough that Southwark has done a deal to redevelop 21 hectares of its land with a Tory-donating tax-avoiding company. The least it should do is comply with the Mayor's minimum affordable housing/viability review requirements.
