title: Delays and Delancey

## A New Post

In the face of a judicial review of their planning approval for the shopping centre demolition and redevelopment, centre owners and developer Delancey are showing a touching concern for the welfare of the traders, making noises about how any 'delays' can have only a bad effect on them.

Such crocodile-tears are entirely self-serving - Delancey hope that by playing on the anxieties of the traders, it can distract from the legal scrutiny of Southwark Council's decision-making, as well as its own footdragging.  Delancey has not previously been in any hurry to settle the centre's future, other than entirely on their own terms, amply demonstrated by the snail's pace progress of their planning application.  It is a story of constant deferrment, caused by Delancey's refusal to meet the minimum requirement's of teh Council's own local plan.

Delancey are culpable in 3 areas - the affordable retail offer, the relocation of the traders and the affordable housing offer. 

The [application](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!jyNktp6uoRKVofXMUvOmvA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) was lodged on the 28 October 2016 and included a [Retail Assessment]() which said _'The Proposals do not include 10% affordable retail for the reasons outlined later. This would be unviable and inappropriate given the intention to create a strong retail/leisure anchor at the heart of the town centre'_ (4.63).  The offer inched up to the equivalent of 5.3% affordable retail, including an in leiu payment and the application was scheduled for a planning  meeting on 18 Dec 2017, when Delancey, no doubt fearing a refusal(despite the planning [officer recommending approval](OR 181217 para 96)), asked for a deferral _'to allow time for further negotiations in relation to the affordable retail proposal'_ (para 3) .  These negotiations finally achieved [a policy compliant offer](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!k0%2f9zNPAdMf5Ya4yWjd0Bw%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) by Jan 2018, fully 15 months after the application was first made.

Delancey reinforced its sniffy view that affordable retail was _'inappropriate'_, as well as unviable, with the opinion that '_it is recognised that some existing retailers in the area are benefitting from  disproportionately low levels of rent for such a central London location...'_.  Nonetheless Delancey condescended to a relocation strategy for traders - but only [after it secured planning permission](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!LnbCaTCiMmUoN4H%2fUA2yyg%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d)(Para 8.7).  A draft strategy, put together without any input from traders, appeared in August 2017, a year after this statement.  Apart from the insufficient amount of affordable retail, which Delancey were obliged to provide anywy, the strategy did not include anywhere for the traders to move to, during building of the new development.  This would have to wait another 6 months, until Feb 2018, when the Castle Square (13 Feb 2018 lett link) temporary facility for traders was proposed (link 35% blog, OR 030718).

Alongside this, similiar delays plagued the affordable housing offer, which Delancey only slowly and reluctantly improved because of fierce campaigning opposition.  It took Delancey 21 months (Oct 2016 - July 2017) to progress from the initial offer to their final, approved proposal, which still fell short of the affordable housing requirement. 

The entire absence of genuine social rented housing in the intial offer ( a meagre 33 'social rent equivalents' out of 979 total units were proposed ) provoked most anger.  This went up to 74 units in Feb 2018 (link 13 Feb letter) and then 116 units, five months latteer, in July 2018 (OR270618 link), with the promise they would be 'proper' social rent. These concesssions though, came with a _quid pro quo_, raising the income thresholds of 116 Discounted Market Rent units to £80,000- £90,000 pa (OR 270618 para 379 link); this was too much for Mayor Sadiq Kahn who insisted on their reduction to £60,000 pa.(link GLA Stage 2 para 30). on his favoured London Living Rent (equivalents). The complete affordable housing was made up of 53 London Living Rent units, but still fell short of the 170 or so social rented units the adopted local plan requires.

The shilly-shallying was reflected in the applications progress through the planning committee. The application was deferred three times (on the 18 Dec 2017, 16 Jan 2018, 30 Jan 2018) until final approval on 3 July 2018.

This entailed 4 versions of an expanding officer's report, which had to recap the reasons for each successive delay and recount the improvements wrenched from a reluctant Delancey, while simultaneously insisting that the planning committee should approve the application,  because it was the best that could be got (including the 'maximum amount of affordable housing'), despite having said exactly the same the last time at a previous meeting.

Not the end of the saga - Castle Sa another 6 months, Jan 2019

Another 10 years for social rented units delivery

it might be argued that this was Delancey 'listening' and responding to the communities concerns, but this would only be true if it had met the local plan's requirements in the first instance; the truth is that it is a well-rehearsed cdeveloper tactic- offer as little as you gain get away with, and then make 'concessions'



The application was presented to the planning committee on the 16 January.  It had generated over a thousand objections and united local ward councillors, Labour and Liberal Democrat, traders, shopping centre users, local residents and housing campaigners against Delancey and its scheme.  Nonetheless Southwark's planning department recommneded it for approval 




This is not just a succession of unrelated omissions, but a deliberate developer tactic, to wear down opposition to proposals that don't conform to the local plan and don't deliver the benefits required to loccal people.  The discredited viability appraisals supplies handy pretexts.

So Delancey is not really in any position to accuse others of 'delay'.  The pace of th entire proces has been pretty much under their control since day one and there is little doubt that if they had come forward with the proposal as it now is - with affordable retail, Castle Sq, 116 social rented units, Traders Panel, arelocation fund - that, however inadequate this all still is, that the would have been easily passed at the very first planning meeting back on 18 Dec 2017.

hows the real cause of the traders' plight and exposes Delancey's insincerity

of  The real cause of 'delay' Delancey has been determined to give as little as possible to others, including traders, while taking as much as possible for themselves.  determination to resist every requirement put which  is rooted in D through the planning process exposes Delancey's insincerity

on 4 Jan 2018, with a [letter to Southwark] saying _'The Applicant is revising the affordable retail element of the proposed scheme such that the full 10% floorspace requirement will be delivered on both the East and West Sites.....The revised on-site approach renders the planning application policy compliant in terms of affordable retail provision...'_.
