title: Delays and Delancey

## A New Post

In the face of a potential judicial review of their planning approval for the shopping centre demolition and redevelopment, centre owners and developer's Delancey have developed a touching concern for the welfare of the traders, with noises about how any 'delays' can have only a bad effect on them.

These crocodile-tears are entirely self-serving - Delancey hope that by playing on the anxieties of the traders, it can deter any legal scrutiny of Southwark Council's decision-making.  Delancey has not previosly been in any hurry to settle the centre's future, unless it is to be entirely on their own terms.  This is amply demonstrated  the snail's pace progress of their development application through the planning process.

The [application](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!jyNktp6uoRKVofXMUvOmvA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) was lodged on the 28 October 2016.  A [planning statement](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!LnbCaTCiMmUoN4H%2fUA2yyg%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) which gives a general overview of proposed developments, had previously been prepared in August 2016.  You will search this in vain for any mention of the affordable retail offer, a critical element any retail development.  Look in the [Retail Assessment]() and we find out why.  It says _'The Proposals do not include 10% affordable retail for the reasons outlined later. This would be unviable and inappropriate given the intention to create a strong retail/leisure anchor at the heart of the town centre'_ (4.63).  This omission was not completely remedied until 4 Jan 2018, a year and a half later, with a [letter to Southwark](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!k0%2f9zNPAdMf5Ya4yWjd0Bw%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) saying _'The Applicant is revising the affordable retail element of the proposed scheme such that the full 10% floorspace requirement will be delivered on both the East and West Sites.....The revised on-site approach renders the planning application policy compliant in terms of affordable retail provision...'_

This is not just a succession of unrelated omissions, but a deliberate developer tactic, to wear down opposition to proposals that don't conform to the local plan and don't deliver the benefits required to loccal people.  The discredited viability appraisals supplies handy pretexts.

So Delancey is not really in any position to accuse others of 'delay'.  The pace of th entire proces has been pretty much under their control since day one and there is little doubt that if they had come forward with the proposal as it now is - with affordable retail, Castle Sq, 116 social rented units, Traders Panel, arelocation fund - that, however inadequate this all still is, that the would have been easily passed at the very first planning meeting back on 18 Dec 2017.

hows the real cause of the traders' plight and exposes Delancey's insincerity

of  The real cause of 'delay' Delancey has been determined to give as little as possible to others, including traders, while taking as much as possible for themselves.  determination to resist every requirement put which  is rooted in D through the planning process exposes Delancey's insincerity
