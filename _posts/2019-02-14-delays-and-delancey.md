## A New Post

In the face of a potential judicial review of their planning approval for the shopping centre demolition and redevelopment, centre owners and developer's Delancey have developed a touching concern for the welfare of the traders, with noises about how any 'delays' can have only badly a bad effect on them.

This is entirely self-serving - Delancey hope that by playing on the anxieties of the traders, any legal scrutiny of Southwark Council's decision-making can be deterred.  Until now, Delancey has not been in any hurry to settle the centre's future, unless it is to be entirely on their own terms.  This amply demonstrated  the snail's pace progress of their development application through the planning process.

The [application](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!jyNktp6uoRKVofXMUvOmvA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) was lodged on the 28 October 2016.  A [planning statement](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!LnbCaTCiMmUoN4H%2fUA2yyg%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) which gives a general overview of proposed developments, had previously been prepared in August 2016.  You will search this in vain for any mention of the affordable retail offer, a critical element any retail development.  Look in the [Retail Statement]() and we find out why    
This is not just a succession of unrelated omissions, but a deliberate developer tactic, to wear down opposition to proposals that don't conform to the local plan and don't deliver the benefits required to loccal people.  The discredited viability appraisals supplies handy pretexts.

So Delancey is not really in any position to accuse others of 'delay'.  The pace of th entire proces has been pretty much under their control since day one and there is little doubt that if they had come forward with the proposal as it now is - with affordable retail, Castle Sq, 116 social rented units, Traders Panel, arelocation fund - that, however inadequate this all still is, that the would have been easily passed at the very first planning meeting back on 18 Dec 2017.
