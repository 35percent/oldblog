Southwark Council leader Peter John has been grilled by Australian national broadcaster 
ABC, about the Heygate redevelopment in a report [broadcast](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-11-11/homes-for-profit-not-people./8019560) on Australian prime time television.

ABC reporter Steve Cannane has also posted his full 20min interview with Cllr John online, in which Cllr John defends the (shotgun) deal he [signed](http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/4712) with Australian developer Lendlease just weeks after being elected in 2010.

Cllr John make a number of unsubstantiated or inaccurate claims which will be familiar to those who have followed the Heygate saga. 

## No profit for Southwark
Cllr John says that Southwark will receive a share of the profits _"north of £100m"_, but we won't know exactly how much until the development, now known as Elephant Park is completed in 2025. The 35% Campaign is glad to help Cllr John on this point. We have received the 2016 Elephant Park Business Plan in response to an [FOI request](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/heygate_estate_regeneration_annu) and this baldly [states](http://35percent.org/2016-05-11-no-profit-share-the-true-value-of-the-heygate-regeneration/) that _"no profit overage is currently forecast to be payable to Southwark Council"_, adding for good measure _"previous plan reported nil overage payable"_ too.

Southwark will continue to receive these reports every year until the completion of the development, because of entirely sensible provisions in the [contractual regeneration agreement](https://southwarknotes.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/ra.pdf) with Lendlease, which says that the Annual Business Plan will be supplied to the Council and that it will contain _"an update of potential Planning Overage and Profit Overage"._ (paragraph 13.2)

Cllr John also claims that profit would be shared in stages as the development proceeds.
Not so; according to the regeneration agreement (see paragraphs 6.1.1 of schedule 5 and the bottom of page 83). Lendlease also removes any doubt on this point by its statement to ABC: "quote from LL"

## Some further points to be noted about Southwark's overage profit share.
Southwark will be getting only 50% of the profit above Lendlease's ringfenced 20% "Priority Return" plus its 2.6% "Management Fee"[^1]. The management fee was criticised by the [District Valuer's review](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/DVSreport_HeygateOutline.pdf) of the viability assessment figures, which he described as 'additional profit'.

Cllr John claims that _"20-25% is a normal profit margin for developments in London"_. However, the [District Valuer](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/district-valuer-services-dvs/about) questioned this profit level and pointed out that most schemes at the time averaged below 15%:

Lendlease has a track record for accounting disputes over such agreements with public authorities. In April 2012 it was [fined](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/25/nyregion/lend-lease-expected-to-admit-to-fraud-scheme.html) $56m for overbilling on a major public works contract in New York and in December 2012 it was [sued](http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/valuation-dispute-poses-threat-to-1b-return-from-barangaroo-20121206-2ay9e.html) by city authorities over its calculation of overage on the Barangaroo regeneration scheme in Australia, a case the Sydney authority [lost](http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/barangaroo-public-works-in-doubt-after-government-loses-court-battle-with-lend-lease-20140821-106lke.html))In 2014 it was embroiled in a [High Court battle](http://www.pitcher.com.au/news/lend-lease-decision-impact-property-development-arrangements) with the Victoria Urban Development Authority in Northern Australia.

## Southwark spends, Lendlease profits
While Southwark lives in hope, profits for Lendlease are rolling in; Southwark has [spent £51.4m on the scheme to date](http://35percent.org/heygate-regeneration-faq/#decant-costs) and received £18m of the £50m land payment. Meanwhile, Lendlease has [reported record profits](http://www.afr.com/real-estate/commercial/lendlease-firsthalf-net-profit-rises-121pc-to-354-million-20160216-gmvxux) of $354m(£192m) for the six months up to Feb 2016. Lendlease [said](http://www.smh.com.au/business/property/lendlease-reports-a-3538-million-profit-20160216-gmvo2z.html) its strong performance was partly down to _“strong sales momentum at residential projects at Victoria Harbour in Melbourne and Elephant & Castle in London”._

Its [August 2016 financial report](/img/LLfinancialreport_aug2016.pdf) confirms that the completed phase 1 of the Heygate (Trafalgar Place) turned a profit in 2016 and that phases two and three (South Gardens and West Grove) are also due to turn a profit in 2018/19.

*Extract from Lendlease's [financial report Aug 2016](/img/LLfinancialreport_aug2016.pdf)*

The report also shows that Lendlease had presold 69% of its apartments in phase 3 (West Grove) off plan, netting it $435m (£260m) before construction had barely started. 

## Revolving doors
During the interview Cllr John was also asked about accepting gifts and a paid trip to a developers jamboree in the South of France from Lendlease. He was also asked whether it was right for senior Council officers to go on to work for developers such as Lendlease. Councillor John failed to give a direct response, but mumbled something about perception not always being reality. Actually the reality is clear, we have published [here](http://35percent.org/revolving-doors/) details of the senior officers who have gone on to work for Lendlease.

## Key documents still witheld
Cllr John makes a big claim for Southwark's commitment to transparency, but in reality the Council continues to withold key figures and documents relating to the deal. Cllr John says that Southwark will be getting a share of the Elephant Park profits 'north of £100m', when all the available evidence is to the contrary. If Cllr John knows something that we and the people of Southwark don't know, he should tell us. In particular, Southwark should publish a full unredacted copy of the most recent [Annual Business Plan](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/heygate_estate_regeneration_annu). This shows the inflows and outflows to the development and whether there will be any overage for the Council.

In addition, Southwark should publish:

1. [The professional advice](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/financial_advice_on_signing_rege) that the Council received from external consultants on signing the regeneration agreement.

2. The unpublished appendices of the [regeneration agreement](https://southwarknotes.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/ra.pdf) between Southwark and Lendlease.

3. A full undredacted copy of the [District Valuer's report](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/DVSreport_HeygateOutline.pdf).
