Delancey has finally submitted its application for the redevelopment of the E&C shopping centre and LCC campus. 

The application's [planning statement](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!LnbCaTCiMmUoN4H%2fUA2yyg%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) says just a few words about the existing retailers in the shopping centre:

It makes a vague offer of some kind of _'relocation strategy'_ but fails to explain what this involves and says this will only be implemented _'following the grant of planning permission'_.

## Affordable housing
The [affordable housing statement](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!i%2fH2BvEXXozMcypxg9AnYA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) says that there will be 35% affordable housing, but comprising entirely Discounted Market Rent. It doesn't say exactly what level of discount will be applied, but does say that rents will be set at up to 80% of market rent. It says only that 40% of the affordable housing will be at rents equivalent or lower than London Living Rent - this is currently calculated at around £1000pcm for a 1-bed at the Elephant. It also says _"The blended percentage of market rent across all the DMR homes is 57% with a range
of 15% to 80% of Market Rent."_ What does it mean by a 'blended percentage'?I don't take this to be a weighted average although that is how it comes across..

The Financial Viability Assessment summary submitted by Delancey includes double counting (acquisition costs (BLV) included as a cost) and inflated Benchmark Land Value. Delancey paid £80m for the shopping centre site in 2013. The shopping centre previously exchanged hands in 2003 for £25m. LCC?

## CPO
Section 38(6) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004, requires proposals to be determined in accordance with the Development Plan unless other materials considerations indicate otherwise. The development plan is the Core Strategy, the E&C SPD and the New Southwark Plan, all of which state that 35% of new residential housing must be affordable; 50% of which social rented. This application is clearly in breach of the development plan and as such would have been open to challenge should it come to a compulsory purchase order. But despite being elected on pledge to tackle the housing crisis, be tough on developers and require 50% of all new developments to be 'genuinely affordable', he has provided Delancey with a convenient get-out. 

Delancey was in a corner: all of Southwark's planning policies said 35% affordable of which 50% social rented. It's no coincidence that Delancey submitted the application a week..
