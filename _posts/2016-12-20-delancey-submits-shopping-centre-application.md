Developers Delancey have finally submitted its application for the redevelopment of the Elephant & Castle shopping centre and London College of Communication campus.  It will be a mixed use development of shops, offices, homes and leisure facilities, including a cinema.  It will also provide a new entrance and ticket-hall for the Northern Line tube station.

According to the [affordable housing statement](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!i%2fH2BvEXXozMcypxg9AnYA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) all the proposed 979 residential units will be for rent, none for sale.  There will be 35% affordable housing, but none of it will be social rented or part-buy/part-rent.  Instead the affordable housing will be something called 'Dicounted Market Rent' (DMR), let at a _'blended average'_ of 57% market rent (ranging from 15%-80% market rent).  40% of the affordable housing will be let at the new London Living Rent, which would currently be [around Â£1000pcm for a 1-bed flat at the Elephant](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/london_living_rent_-_monthly_ward-level_rents_by_size.xlsx).

The affordable housing will not be let or managed by a housing association, as is usual, but privately owned and managed by Delancey company [Elephant and Castle Properties Limited](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/04434716/officers), whose current officers are based in Bermuda and the British Virgin Isles.  The affordable housing tenants would be on a 3-year assured
short-hold tenancies, not an assured tenancy with no time limit, as issued by housing associations.

As expected the shopping centre is to be demolished and there will be [no room for most of the existing retailers](http://35percent.org/2015-07-12-shopping-centre-and-lcc-redevelopment-proposals/).  Delancey's [planning statement](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!LnbCaTCiMmUoN4H%2fUA2yyg%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) contends that _'it is recognised that some existing retailers in the area are benefitting from disproportionately lowlevels of rent...'_ and concludes that _'it may not be financially viable for them to survvive in the area in the longer term'_.  Delancey offer a relocation strategy, but only if it is awarded planning permission.

Delancey make it clear in their [Affordable Housing Statement](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!i%2fH2BvEXXozMcypxg9AnYA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) that the application has been drafted after _'extensivediscussions...with the Council...and...GLA'_(para 5.1).  It is also clear that much of these discussions were about changing the affordable housing rules to allow Delancey to avoid building social rented housing.  Southhwark has shown its affection for so-called 'Build to Rent' in its recent draft of the [Old Kent Rd Area Action Plan/Opportunity Area Framework](http://35percent.org/2016-11-21-old-kent-road-aap-loopholes/) and the _'flexibility'_ this allows 'Build to Rent' in the delivery of affordable housing is duly noted by Delancy (para 3.32).  Our new London Mayor, Sadiq Khan, also reveals his entusiasm for 'Build to Rent' in the just issued [draft Affordable Hosuing and Viability Supplementary Planning Guidance](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/draft_affordable_housing_and_viability_spg_2016.pdf) so Delancey can cofidently state that the Mayor's _'Housing SPG will likely promote the 100% discounted market rent solutions on large scale sites'_.

So, while this application is from Delancey, there can be little doubt it is coming forward with the blessing of both Southwark Council and the MAyor of London.  None of the latest London Plan or local plan documents Delancey refers to to justify its departures from affordable housing policy have been adopted, but are out for consultation or still to be consulted on.  They all promote radical changes to affordable housing affordable housing in unison, changes that will exclude social rented houisng from major new developments.

Delancey's application is just another step down the gentrification road.  It hais little in it that will help those who can only afford social rented housing; indeed it is purposely designed ot exclude them from the proposed development.  The shopkeepers and and small traders, many from ethnic minority backgrounds, who have worked hard to become an intergral part of teh community, are deemed to be _'not financially viable ...to survive'_. Southwark Council and the Mayor should be making it to Delancey how unacceptable this application is, not changing planning policy to ensure its success.
