Guardian columnist, Labour hack and [gentrification 
apologist](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/oct/24/lets-get-our-gentrification-story-straight) 
Dave Hill, has written an 
[article](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/nov/01/london-housing-sadiq-khan-research-brief-recognises-need-for-overseas-investors) 
claiming that 'foreign buyers have been made an easy scapegoat' for the high 
cost of housing the capital.

The article refers to research being commissioned by City Hall, which is 
attempting to address _'concerns about the role that overseas money plays in 
London’s property market'_ and _"the positive role that overseas buyers play in 
enabling developments to go ahead."_
 
Dave Hill argues that _"a considerable amount of London’s new “affordable” 
homes aimed at people on low and middle incomes are built as a condition of 
permission being granted for large, foreigner-financed housing schemes to go 
ahead. "_

Last week, the Evening Standard ran a [big splash](/img/standard26102016.pdf) 
echoing a similar perspective. It claimed that with 2-beds in [Elephant 
Park](http://elephantpark.co.uk) selling for just shy of £1m, there was 
_'sympathy for the Heygate residents who put up such a fight to stop the 
redevelopment'_, but that locals can still pick up an 'affordable' shared 
ownership flat for just £111,250 (for a 25% share of a 1-bed).

What the article doesn't mention is that of the 360 new homes in ['South 
Gardens'](http://www.elephantpark.co.uk/elephant-park/explore-the-development/south-garden) 
(the next phase under development), only 25 are available for shared ownership 
and only 7 units are left unsold[^1]. The small print in the [price 
list](https://lqpricedin.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Elephant-park-1-bed-October16.pdf) 
also shows that a minimum deposit of £30k is required, as is a minimum income 
of £42,918. 

## The private units
The 284 private units in South Gardens have been heavily marketed overseas.  
Colliers International was 
[appointed](http://www.costar.co.uk/en/assets/news/2013/April/Lend-Lease-picks-Colliers-to-drive-Elephant-overseas-housing-sales/) 
by Lendlease to market its homes in Singapore and Hong Kong. 

Colliers launched sales at South Gardens during [an event on 11th April 
2014](http://www.propertyguru.com.sg/property-management-news/2014/4/37646/elephant-park-sales-in-singapore) 
in Singapore. Within a month it sold 55? apartments.
