## The rise of BtR

London Mayor Sadiq Khan has given Grovesnor Estate's (link) plans for the redevelopment of the Peek Frean's factory site a second chance, after they were summarily rejected by Southwark's planning committee back in February 2019 (link).  Mayor Khan used his powers to 'call-in' the application and become the decision-maker himself.  A consultation on a new set of proposals has now concluded  and a there will be a hearing on these (link), on a date yet to be set, when a decision will be made.  

One of the main reason's for the Southwark rejecting the application was the poor affordable housing offer - no social rented housing out of over 1300 new homes;  Grosvenor instead proposed 27% (check) affordable housing, all at an affordable rent of 75% market rent (link).   

All the housing would Build to Rent (BtR), a private sector housing tenure that is set to play an increasing role in housing development, if policy-makers and developers get their way.  As well as the Biscuit Factory, developer Delancey's plan's for the shopping centre includes nearly a thousand BtR units. 

BtR rise can be charted by its increasing prominence in the successive versions of the London Plan (the Mayor's book of rules for development in London( (link).  In the 2011 version it is barely mentioned; Boris Johnson's 2016 London Plan (the current one) opened the door, but it is Sadiq Khan's new London Plan that really promotes it as a favoured tenure (Link), along with a sister policy document, the Affordable Housing and Viability SPD (link). Between them they provide all a developer needs to justify BtR developments to London borough planning committees.  (Southwark is following the Mayor's lead in it's own New Southwark Plan, with a whole new policy P4 devoted to BtR.

## The problem with BtR

The problem with BtR, in short, is that it does not actually have any affordable housing, as has it has been recognised up until now. This was basically social rent and intermediate housing (part-buy/part-rent). Affordable rent (at up to 80% market rent),added in 2012 (check), has evolved in London Affordable Rent (LAR) and London Living Rent (LLR) under, Sadiq Khan.  There are big differences in rent/cost levels between these different kinds of affordable housing, but what they share is _relatively_ stable tenures; social rent and affordable rent are on assured or secure tenancies, with eventual ownership the ambition in the case of intermediate housing.

BtR affordable housing does not supply this kind of affordable housing. It does not have social rent, intermediate rent or even Sadiq Khan's favoured LAR or LLR, as such.  Instead it provides Discounted Market Rent (DMR) 'products' - homes let at various rent levels, according to the household incomes, and calculated as percentages of market rents, let on assured shorthold tenancies (ASTs).  These products can then described as 'equivalents' eg social rent equivalent and passed off as the real thing.

The Biscuit Factory is a good example of this.  The new proposal that Sadiq Khan is considering is for 1,548 units with 35% affordable housing, split 30:70 between social rent equivalent and DMR, for household incomes of up to £60,000pa (LLR equivalent).  The social rent equivalent rents range from £134pw (1 bed) to £178pw (4 bed), the DMR rents will be 'an average of £323'.  In comparison a draft of the New Southwark Plan gives average social rents in Soutwark (March 2016) as £107pw to £157pw (screenshot).

All tenacies will be AST, from 1-5 years, but with the tenant having the right to renew 'subject to pre-determined criteria'.
