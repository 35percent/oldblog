## The rise of BtR

London Mayor Sadiq Khan has given Grovesnor Estate's (link) plans for the redevelopment of the Peek Frean's factory site a second chance, after they were summarily rejected by Southwark's planning committee back in February 2019 (link).  Mayor Khan used his powers to 'call-in' the application and become the decision-maker himself.  A consultation on a new set of proposals has now concluded  and a there will be a hearing on these (link), on a date yet to be set, when a decision will be made.  

One of the main reason's for the Southwark rejecting the application was the poor affordable housing offer - no social rented housing out of over 1300 new homes;  Grosvenor instead proposed 27% (check) affordable housing, all at an affordable rent of 75% market rent (link).   

All the housing would Build to Rent (BtR), a private sector housing tenure that is set to play an increasing role in housing development, if policy-makers and developers get their way.  As well as the Biscuit Factory, developer Delancey's plan's for the shopping centre includes nearly a thousand BtR units. 

BtR rise can be charted by its increasing prominence in the successive versions of the London Plan (the Mayor's book of rules for development in London( (link).  In the 2011 version it is barely mentioned; Boris Johnson's 2016 London Plan (the current one) opened the door, but it is Sadiq Khan's new London Plan that really promotes it as a favoured tenure (Link), along with a sister policy document, the Affordable Housing and Viability SPD (link). Between them they provide all a developer needs to justify BtR developments to London borough planning committees.  (Southwark is following the Mayor's lead in it's own New Southwark Plan, with a whole new policy P4 devoted to BtR.

## The problem with BtR

The problem with BtR, in short, is that it does not actually have any affordable housing, as has it has been recognised up until now. This was basically social rent and intermediate housing (part-buy/part-rent). Affordable rent (at up to 80% market rent),added in 2012 (check), has evolved in London Affordable Rent (LAR) and London Living Rent (LLR) under, Sadiq Khan.  There are big differences in rent/cost levels between these different kinds of affordable housing, but what they share is _relatively_ stable tenures; social rent and affordable rent are on assured or secure tenancies, with eventual ownership the ambition in the case of intermediate housing.

BtR affordable housing does not supply this kind of affordable housing. It does not provide social rent, intermediate rent or even Sadiq Khan's favoured LAR or LLR, as such.  Instead it provides Discounted Market Rent (DMR) 'products' - homes let at various rent levels, according to the household incomes, and calculated as percentages of market rents, let on assured shorthold tenancies (ASTs).  These products can then described as 'equivalents' eg social rent equivalent and passed off as the real thing.

The Biscuit Factory is a good example of this.  The new proposal that Sadiq Khan is considering is for 1,548 units with 35% affordable housing, split 30:70 between social rent equivalent and DMR, for household incomes of up to £60,000pa (LLR equivalent).  The social rent equivalent rents range from £134pw (1 bed) to £178pw (4 bed), the DMR rents will be 'an average of £323'.  In comparison a draft of the New Southwark Plan gives average social rents in Soutwark (March 2016) as £107pw to £157pw (screenshot).

All tenacies will be AST, from 1-5 years, but with the tenant having the right to renew 'subject to pre-determined criteria'.

Objection

We wish to make the following objections to this planning application:
1.	That the application is for a Build to Rent (BtR) development, a type of housing unsupported by Southwark Council’s Local Plan.
2.	BtR is being introduced in the draft New Southwark Plan (NSP), but this is only emerging policy and can only be accorded limited weight in planning decisions.
3.	The applicable affordable housing policy should therefore be Core Strategy SP6, which requires 35% Affordable Housing, with a tenure split in the Bermondsey area of 70:30 between Social Rent: Intermediate Housing (24.5%:10.5% of total housing).  On this basis and using the figures in the Affordable Housing Statement (Tables 4.5 and 4.7) the development should provide 977 habitable rooms (hr) of Social Rent and 419 hr of Intermediate housing.
4.	The Applicant’s offer of 35% Affordable Housing comprises 421 hr SRE and 976 hr Intermediate housing, a shortfall of 556 hr Social Rent and ‘overprovision’ of 557 hr Intermediate, tabulated below:

Applicant offer	SP6 requirement	Difference (hr)
Total	3,989		Total	3,989		-
Afford Housing	1397	35%	Affordable Housing	1397	35%	-
SRE	421	10.5%	Social Rent	977	24.5%	-556
DMR	976	24.5%	Intermediate	419	10.5%	+557


5.	This is a shortfall of approximately 190 units of social rented housing.
6.	SRE is not the same as Social Rent on at least two counts; the tenure is for 1- 5 years only, on an assured shorthold tenancy (AST), not an assured or secure tenancy (Affordable Housing Statement 4.12).
7.	SRE rents are also higher than Social Rent.  The SRE rents the Applicant proposes are;

•	I bed - £134p/w
•	2 bed - £160p/w
•	3 bed - £169p/w
•	4 bed - £178p/w
(Affordable Housing Statement 4.24)
8.	These are in every instance, except 4 bed, higher than those given in draft New Southwark Plan (NSP) lists for average local social rent levels :
Bedrooms	Social rent (formula rent)
1 bedroom  	£107.32
2 bedrooms 	£126.08 
3 bedrooms 	£146.11 
4 bedrooms 	£157.46

9.	Notwithstanding all the above, and measuring the Application against local emerging policy, the Application does not meet the requirements of the relevant NSP, policy P4, which requires 35% Affordable Housing, 15% of the total housing to be Social Rent Equivalent (SRE) rent and 20% at London Living Rent (LLR).

10.	The Applicant’s affordable housing offer is of 35% Affordable Housing, but with 10.6% SRE and 24.5% LLR.  This calculation is made on the basis of the habitable room figures provided in the Affordable Housing Statement (Tables 4.5 and 4.7), tabulated here:
	Applicant offer	P4 requirement	Difference (hr)
Total	3,989		3,989		-
Afford Housing	1397	35%	1397	35%	-
SRE	421	10.5%	598	15%	- 177
DMR	976	24.5%	798	20%	+ 178

11.	The Applicant is ‘overproviding’ 178 hr of LLR, while underproviding 177 hr of SRE.  This is approximately 60 units.
12.	We note that the BtR covenant is for 15 years (Affordable Housing Statement 4.13), half the 30-year covenant of P4 1.6 and that there does not appear to be an explicit commitment in the Application that the DMR housing will be secured as affordable housing in perpetuity.
13.	In summary the Application abides by neither the adopted or the emerging Local Plan and will not deliver Social Rented housing, but a poor substitute, which is less secure, and more expensive for the tenant.
14.	In terms of numbers, the Application will deliver a shortfall of SRE/Social Rent of either 556 hr or 177hr, depending on the policy measure used, approximately 190 and 60 SRE/Social Rent units respectively.
15.	We therefore urge the Mayor to reject this application.
