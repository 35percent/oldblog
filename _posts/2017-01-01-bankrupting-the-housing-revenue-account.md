The Council's Housing Revenue Account is its budget account for council housing; it is the budget account that council rents are paid into and the account from which money is taken to spend on repairs to council homes.

[Annex C](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/annexc.pdf) of the Council's 2005 [decision](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/CeListDocuments.aspx?CommitteeId=118&MeetingId=986&DF=27/09/2005&Ver=2) to progress the scheme shows that it estimated that the cost to the Council would be just £16m over 10 years.

It's not just Council money that has been swallowed up by the scheme
The scheme has also digested a staggering 69m of government funding (56m NDC plus 13m HCA)
en allocated 46m from the government’s Estate Regeneration Fund and £27m from GLA funding to date, plus £13m of HCA funding

## Temporary accommodation
southwark is currently spending £2.24m per year to private landlords to accommodate 350 homeless households in B&B accommodation (£6.4k per household per year). Were it to use the empty homes on the FDS to house these then it would run surplus of £6,500 per household per year. 

## Aylesbury costs means budget cuts
The huge allocation of funds to the Aylesbury regeneration has meant cuts elsewhere. This yeare the Council has [cut](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s59115/Policy%20and%20Resources%20Strategy%20201617%20to%20201819.pdf) a staggering £39m from its budget for education and adult services. Here is a map of some adult services buildings that have been, or are being sold off or closed down by the Council's current (Labour) administration:

Besides closing down or selling off its community and social services facilities, the Council has been busy [selling off its Town Halls](http://35percent.org/southwark-town-halls/) and street properties. This is not to mention the hundreds of council homes [sold at auction](/images/sold_by_southwark.pdf) by the Council's current (Labour) administration.


## Dilapidation by design
When Southwark Council says that the buildings are leaking and beyond repair, it means they haven't cleaned the gutters for 10 years.

## 11000 new council homes
During the interview, Cllr John brushes off criticism concerning the loss of social housing on the Heygate, with the claim that Southwark has got the country's largest council house building programme, with a target of building 11,000 new council homes over the next 30 years (366 per year).  
However, [data just published by the 
government](https://medium.com/@lukewbarratt/fact-checking-hackney-mayor-philip-glanville-on-social-housing-b3ceeeaf53e3#.149mqus0q) shows that during the last 12 months Southwark built just 74 new council homes. At this rate it will be 149 years before it reaches its target of 11,000 new council homes.
  
[Government 
data](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/568423/LiveTable_123.xls) shows that in the same year it demolished 410 homes.
