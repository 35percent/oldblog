Thanks to the general public's wonderful contributions to our [crowdfunding campaign](link), we were able to submit our grounds of defence to Southwark's high court appeal of the [Aylesbury CPO decison](link) on Wednesday. 
The Secretary of State also submitted his grounds of defence and we are glad to see that he is sticking to his [pledge](http://35percent.org/img/SoSresponsetoLbC.pdf) to _"defend the claim robustly"_. 

A hearing date of 9th May has been set when the case will be heard at the Royal Courts of Justice. We still need funds in order to be represented on the day by a barrister - we are only £3k away from our £10k requirement, pls give generously. 

## Response to Mayor's viabilty SPG
Mayor's new viability SPG is piss poor and full of ready-made get-out clauses for developers, particulary around land value. 
Sadiq Khan has completed Boris's unfinished goal of peverting the term 'affordable housing'.

Diffrent Mayor; business as usual.

Plus ca change, plus c'est la meme chose.

Here's our [detailed response](link) as if it mattered..

## Response to Mayor's estate regeneration guidance
Mayor's estate regeneration guidance is equally piss poor.

Not even the requirement for a ballot.
In contrast, it actually recommends to avoiding ballots!

Here's our [detailed response](link) as if were going to have any impact anyway..

What a complete cop out etc.

Boo to all those lefty academics who recommended we vote for Sadiq Khan..
