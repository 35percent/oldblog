subtitle: >-
  Secretary of State delivers on promise to 'robustly defend' his decision
  against Southwark's appeal
---

Thanks to the general public's wonderful contributions to our [crowdfunding campaign](https://www.gofundme.com/aylesbury-the-right-to-a-community-2uefgf2s), the Aylesbury Leaseholder Group was able to submit its grounds of defence of the[Aylesbury CPO decison](http://35percent.org/2016-09-18-aylesbury-compulsory-purchase-order-rejected/) last Wedsnesday.  The grounds were prepared by barrister Chris Jacobs, of Landmark Chambers, who successfully represented the leaseholders in the final days of the CPO public inquiry.

This is the latest round in the legal battle to maintain the goverment's refusal to grant Southwark Council ownership of the leaseholder's homes.  Southwark has gone to the High Court for a judicial review of the decision, made by Sajid Javid, Secretary of State, Department of Communities and Local Government.  Mr Javid has also submitted his grounds of defence and the Aylesbury leaseholders are heartened to see that he is sticking to his [pledge](http://35percent.org/img/SoSresponsetoLbC.pdf) to _"defend the claim robustly"_.

The case will be heard at the Royal Courts of Justice on 9 May and the support for the leaseholders is growing.  The Aylesbury' residents have just established a new tenants and residents association, Wendover Community TRA, that is determined to protect their interests.  Southwark Defend Council Housing organised a fundraising benefit for the TRA, with a special screening of 'I, Danial', followed by a discussion led by director Ken Loach.  £600 was raised, with a £100 donated to the leaseholder legal fund. A

There is a realistion across London that this is a decision that has ramifications for all leaseholders on all council estates facing regeneration. Over 180 seperate donations have been made by individuals, union branches, TRAs and campaign groups, to support the leaseholders and the crowd fund stands at over £7000  - but more is needed to ensure that the leaseholders are represented on the 9 May by a barrister, so our new target is £10,000 - please [give generously](https://www.gofundme.com/aylesbury-the-right-to-a-community-2uefgf2s)!
