Southwark Council finally got permission to make its case against the Secretary of State, for his refusal of their CPO request against Aylesbury leaseholders.  It was Southwark's second time of asking and there can now be a full court hearing, involving all parties, including the leaseholders, probably around April.

Southwark Council leader, Peter John, is no doubt relieved by the decision, but also appears to be confused.  The decision does not reverse Sajid Javid's refusal or overturn the CPO- it just allows Southwark to get on to the playing field, so to speak, and make its case.

In giving permission presiding Judge Collins said that Southwark and the Secretary of State should make efforts to 'ameliorate' the leaseholders situation.  Cllr John immediately repeated his call to the Secretary of State, Sajid Javid, to reconsider his decision, through [local media](http://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/council-leader-calls-government-settle-aylesbury-cpo-dispute-outside-court/), selectively quoting Judge Collin's comments, without reference to the leaseholders' plight.

Given Southwark's failure to secure their CPO by following due legal procees, Cllr John's anxiety to make an out of court deal with Mr Javid is understandable.  But any out of court resolution of the situation should be with the leaseholders, not Mr Javid. Cllr John evidently wishes to sideline them and this must not be allowed to happen.  There must be no back-door deals.

Underscoring the need for full transparency, in court Southwark itself noted that the case was of significant public importance.  It argued that the viability of not just the Aylesbury, but all regenerations across London, depend upon limiting the compensation to leaseholders.  Southwark added, for good measure,  that the adverse consequences for the leaseholders could not be avoided, but that they were not relevant.  This is a quite different story to the one told in public, where Southwark insist the 'rent-free' deal offered to leaseholders is fair.

The 35% Campaign is committed to supporting the Aylesbury leaseholders and as this case progresses we  We have now raised over Â£6000 to ensure they are legally represented 


## Den of Iniquity

  Meanwhile it emerged this week that Cllr John has more CPO trouble, this time next door in Lewisham. Cllr John is a director of charity Surrey Canal Sports Foundation[^1].  According to a Guardian report this is being investigated by the Charity Commission after that paper's revelations that SCSF had made false claims about funding from Sport England.  The SCSF was set up and backed by shadowy off-shore developers, Renewal, who  want Lewisham to compulsory purchase land from Millwall football club.  Lewisham seemed happy to oblige, despite the fact that the proposed development of 2,400 homes would only provide 12% affordable housing, none social rented.  Fierce opposition from the club and supporters, plus revelations of local Labour adminstration links to Renewal, have made Lewisham think twice.  Let's hope this is the end for this particular 'Renewal' scheme.
