Southwark Council finally got permission to make its case against the Secretary of State, for his refusal of their CPO request against Aylesbury leaseholders.  It was Southwark's second time of asking and there can now be a full court hearing, involving all parties, including the leaseholders, probably around April.

In giving permission presiding Judge Collins said that Southwark aand the Secretary of State should make efforts to 'ameliorate' the leaseholders situation.  Southwark Council leader, Peter John, immediately repeated his call to the Secretary of State, Sajid Javid, to reconsider his decision, through [local media](http://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/council-leader-calls-government-settle-aylesbury-cpo-dispute-outside-court/), quoting Judge Collin's comments, without reference to the leaseholders' plight.

Cllr John appears to be confused by the decision (and who can blame him, given the revelations of his links to the Millwall development, another controversail CPO)
