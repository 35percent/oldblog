In 2015 we [revealed](SN article) that developers were routinely failing to deliver on affordable housing promises. After the Council [rejected] our complaint we referred it to the Local Government Ombudsman. In October 2016, the Ombudsman delivered a damning report saying that the Council didn't do any monitoring of s106 social housing delivery and relied entirely upon trusting the developer or housing association to deliver it. It concluded 'didn't have any way of knowing how much social housing had been lost" - and ordering the Council to conduct an audit to see how much social housing had been lost and take action to recover it where necessary.

Three years later and a presentation by the Council's s106 manager concludes that:

"It would be good to get a list of stock and have confidence in that list. At the moment we piece together bits from teams across the Council. I'm not sure how accurate it is." (page 11) [business case](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/assets/attach/10952/20190904_AH-Monitoring-Business-Case-for-Alpha-PUBLISH.pdf)

"Monitoring of affordable housing linked to agreements is only feasible for future homes." (page 21).

"There have been two major efforts to recover affordable homes - the Jam Factory and the Signal building. It is not known how many similar cases might be undetected." (page 24)


After countless fruitless efforts chasing Councillors for the audit in the three years that followed, in September this year we decided to ask a formal Cabinet question to the Council leader. The [response] was that..

First impressions:

1. There are xx duplicates
2. There is a substantial amount of missing information. i.e. in 

In its response to our Cabinet question, .... [claims](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning-policy-and-transport-policy/authority-monitoring-report/housing?chapter=7) _"There are 11,999 units managed by RPs in Southwark and there have been 4,320 affordable units secured by S106 legal agreements since 2001"_.

We checked this against the [London Development Database (LDD) of planning permissions](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/planning-permissions-on-the-london-development-database--ldd-), which only goes back to 2006. By filtering this to show [schemes completed in Southwark](http://35percent.org/img/LDD_Southwark.xlsx) we can see that 7,653 affordable homes have been completed in Southwark since 2006.

We didn't have time to go through the entire dataset so we took the twenty largest schemes and cross checked them against Southwark's audit.

## Missing permissions
Cross-check the references from LDD against audit and see what is missing.
Also against that paper list I have.
