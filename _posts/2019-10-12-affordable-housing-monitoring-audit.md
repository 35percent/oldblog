In 2015 we [revealed](SN article) that developers were routinely failing to deliver on affordable housing promises. After the Council [rejected] our complaint we referred it to the Local Government Ombudsman. In October 2016, the Ombudsman delivered a damning report saying that..

Southwark [claims](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning-policy-and-transport-policy/authority-monitoring-report/housing?chapter=7) _"There are 11,999 units managed by RPs in Southwark and there have been 4,320 affordable units secured by S106 legal agreements since 2001"_

But the [London Development Database (LDD) of planning permissions](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/planning-permissions-on-the-london-development-database--ldd-), shows that 7,653 affordable homes have been completed in Southwark since 2006.

We didn't have time to go through the entire dataset so we took the twenty largest schemes and cross checked them against Southwark's audit.
