@. NHHT's commitment to the Scheme is further brought into question when the Acquiring Authority declared at a [Cabinet meeting](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s63817/Report.Aylesbury%20Regeneration%20Delivery.pdf) in September 2016, that "_due to the costs"_ and _"CPO delay"_, NHHT was no longer willing to continue underwriting the ongoing costs of the scheme, i.e the demolition costs for the FDS and costs of design plus preparing the planning applications for the two subsequent phases of development - as per its obligations under the DPA:

@. The DPA stipulates that NHHT must pay the demoliton costs in respect of the FDS (para 4.1.4), the demolition cost was subsequently to be deducted from the £16.3m total (of 3 fixed land payments £1.2m; £2.4m; £12.7m) - (para 1.2.2) that NHHT was supposed to pay the Acquiring Authority upon transfer of the land.

@. NHHT's refusal to carry out its obligations under the terms of the DPA means that, not only is the Acquiring Authority now having to fund the £16.8m demolition costs itself plus a 2% management fee to NHHT, but it will only receive the third (and largest £12.7m) of the £16.3m fixed payments when the FDS development is completed in 2024. 

@. In summary, the Acquiring Authority is having to stump up £16.8m, of which it will receive just £16.3m in return in at least 7 years time - resulting in a net loss on the sale of 4.4 hectares of public-owned land.

@. The Acquiring Authority may argue that it has an 'overage agreement' in the DPA, meaning that it receives a percentage share of NHHT's 'overage' profit. However, such agreements bring notoriously uncertain results, as demonstrated by the Acquiring Authority's regeneration of the Silwood estate in Bermondsey that it redeveloped in partnership with NHHT. A similar agreement here resulted in an 'overage' payment of just £546,047 to the Acquiring Authority. An [FOI request](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/silwood_estate_regeneration_site/new) shows that there was disagreement between the parties about the amount of overage paid with the Acquiring Authority arguing that more overage was due.

@. In total, Southwark agreed to underwrite £26.5m of the ongoing costs of progressing the scheme (over the next 3 years alone) and that NHHT was originally required to fund under the terms of the Development Partnership Agreement. These comprise:

> * £16.8m demolition costs for the First Development Site
> * £0.8m for the demolition of Plot 18
> * £2m to underwrite the cost of Plot 18’s planning application
> * £2m to underwrite the design fees for phase 2
> * £5.5m to construct the replacement facility for Ellison House (check that the DPA says NHHT should pay for this?)

@. These costs are in addition to the Council’s other costs that it has already allocated to the scheme to pay for rehousing of tenants and buy back of leaseholders. In total the Council is now forecast to spend £76.7m (see para 8.14 of the AA's updated SoC) over the next five years on progressing decant and demolition, plus an additional £32.4m on the new community facilities (that were supposed to be funded by the infrastructure tarif).

@. At the previous inquiry it was established that the Acquring Authority had already spent £46m progressing the Scheme up to 2014.

@. These significant funding requirements were not envisaged at the time that the Acquiring Authority made the decision to progress the scheme. In the Sep 27 2005 report to the Executive, members were given costing estimates showing that the redevelopment would be more or less cost neutral to the Acquiring Authority over the duration of the Scheme. 

@. As a result of having to step in and fund the scheme following NHHT's refusal to continue underwriting it, the Acquiring Authority has had to make sweeping cuts to front line services. This year alone saw [cuts](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s59115/Policy%20and%20Resources%20Strategy%20201617%20to%20201819.pdf) to the Adult Care and Education budget of £39m.

@. This is in addition to the care homes and other council-owned facilities that are being sold to help fill the hole in the Acquiring Authority's budget.

![Care homes sold off under budget cuts](http://35percent.org/img/carehomesshutdown.jpg)

@. In total, the Acquiring Authority is required to absorb around £100m of central government budget cuts between now and 2019/20. In addition, it has also estimated a cost of £100m to install sprinklers in its tower blocks following safety concerns arising after the Grenfell Tower disaster.


Subsequent plots: Council pays for demolition and demolition costs are also entered in the development account (as a minus - double counting). So when viability tests show a positive land value (could be £1) then the phase will proceed. I.e. Council is only going to receive something for the land if overage is enough to pay off demolition costs.
