In September last year I [wrote about] the Aylesbury estate regeneration and the Secretary of State's decision to refuse Southwark's application for compulsory purchase powers. Recently, I was contacted anonymously by someone who provided me with a copy of the Council's regeneration agreement with Notting Hill Housing Group for the redevelopment.

The [35% Campaign](http://35percent.org) has long been campaigning for disclosure of the agreement, even [appealing to the Information Commissioner](https://ico.org.uk/media/action-weve-taken/decision-notices/2017/2014556/fer0662249.pdf).

I set to work on working out who gets what from the partnership deal.

The agreement carves the estate up into four phases of which the first is aptly named the First Development Site (FDS). This site is the subject of the current compulsory purchase order proceedings that will be re-examined at a public inquiry in January.

Having paid around £14m[^1] in compensation to the 70 leaseholders displaced from the FDS, Southwark Council is paying £16.8m demolition[^2] and a further £5.5m for the relocation of the Ministry of Justice's probation unit located on the site.

## Land receipts
In return for its sale of the land to Notting Hill Housing Group it will receive just £16.3m in a series of 3 fixed land payments, the last of which is only paid when redevelopment of the site completes.

This is a good deal compared to the land payments the Council will receive for the three remaining phases of the estate. These will be determined by a viability assessment (conducted by Notting Hill) and, crucially, there is no minimum fixed amount. They are determined as the residual value left over after estimated build costs and a 21% profit margin for Notting Hill are deducted from estimated sales revenue:

The development of a given phase will proceed as soon as a viablity assessments shows the residual land value payable to the Council as _'greater than or equal to nil'_.

## Overage
In addition to the land payments, the Council has a 'share of the profits' from the scheme, but this is no ordinary or equal share. Firstly, Notting Hill's 21% priority profit is ringfenced - any surplus profit above this level is then split equally between Notting Hill and the Council. The DPA gives us a worked example of this based on the scenario that the private for sale properties on this phase sell for an average of £550 per sqft:

In this scenario, Notting Hill banks a guaranteed profit of £23m and plus half of the £4.3m overage while Southwark gets just its 50% of the overage (£2.17m). 

## Conclusion
Southwark Council has so far spent £49.1m on the Aylesbury estate regeneration and has allocated a further £52.5m to the scheme over the next 3 years alone[^3]. The crumbs it will receive from the partnership deal with Notting Hill won't go anywhere near making up for this colossal expenditure.

The £101.6m allocated to the scheme to date comes from the Council's Housing Revenue Account (HRA) - this is the Council's rent account for its circa 40,000 council homes in the borough. The HRA is already under immense strain and the Aylesbury regeneration is draining it of vital funds needed to pay for the upkeep and maintenance of other estates in the borough. 

and so the vicious circle of regeneration continues to revolve.. etc..
