title: draft Aylesbury CPO- what's really happened
---
To paraphrase Winston Churchill - there are lies, there are damn lies and then there are Southwark Council  press releases.

A choice example was the triumphant annnouncement of 27 April 2017, headlined 'Secretary of State overturns previous decision regarding Aylesbury estate compulsory purchase order'. It went on to say that improved offers had been made to the leaseholders, leaving the impression that this was reason for the  SoS's change of heart, while neglecting to give the actual reason for his decision.  The press release was the basis of a number of media reports, which related the story with varying degrees of inaccuracy.

The final paragraph of the press release notes that the 'Consent Order is being agreed with the Secretary of State’s lawyers and will be forwarded to the Interested Parties (Aylesbury leaseholders, their legal representatives and the 35% Campaign) shortly for their agreement'. We actually received the Consent Order on the 25 April, with a peremptory deadline for reply of the next day.  This was extended to the 2 May, but it was obviously more important to Southwark to get out a press release than to actually have the courtesy to wait for a reply or indeed wait for the High Court to actually quash the decision.

The SoS conceeded to Southwark's challenge on one single ground, arising from the so-called £16,000 policy.  This stipulated that all a leaseholder's savings, less £16,000, could be required from them if they were to get a new home on a shared-ownership or shared equity basis.  After the CPO inquiry finished Southwark dropped this policy and asked the Secretary of State to take this into account in his consideration of their CPO application.  He did do so, writing to all parties for their views.  He concluded that it did not make any difference to his decision not to grant the CPO, referring to the CPO Inquiry inspector's report for reasons to justify this.  However, by logic, the Inspector's report could not supply such reasons, because the policy change only occurred after the inquiry closed.  An illogical decision cannot be lawful, so the Inspector gave way; his concession had nothing whatsover to do with any non-existent 'improved offers'. 

The leaseholders and interested parties somewhat reluctantly signed the consent to quash the decision.  To do otherwise would have meant proving the SoS was wrong to say he was wrong or face ruinous costs.  It ensured that there would be another public inquiry and we remain fully confident that, having won once, we can win again.


The Secretary of State decided not to contest Southwark's claim on a single ground, which had nothing to to do with any non-existent 'improved offers'.  He therefore proposed asking the court  to quash his decision not to give Southwark its CPO and to hold another CPO inquiry.  His solicitor wrote to the leaseholders and interested parties, including the 35% Campaign, asking for their consent for this, while stating that in any event he would not appear at the scheduled High Court hearing on 9 May.  The leaseholders and interested parties had until 2 May to sign the consent, or continue the defence of a decision he had abandoned -  a difficult task. The leaseholders and interested parties understood that they should not discuss or publicise these proceedings until they were concluded, that to do otherwise would show a lack of courtesy to the courts.
