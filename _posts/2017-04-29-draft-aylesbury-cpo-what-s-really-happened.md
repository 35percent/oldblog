title: draft Aylesbury CPO- what's really happened
---
To paraphrase Winston Churchill - there are lies, there are damn lies and then there are Southwark Council  press releases.
A choice example was the triumphant annnouncement of xx April, headlined 'Secretary of State Sajid Javid reverses his decision not to grant Southwark a compulsory purchase order for the Aylesbury leaseholder's homes, in phase 1b of the regeneration.  It went on to say that improved offers had been made to the leaseholders, leaving the impression that this was reason for the  SoS's change of heart.  

None of this was true.  The Secretary of State had in fact only decided not to contest Southwark's claim that he had got his decision wrong; he did not 'reverse' that decision.  He came to this conclusion on a single ground, which had nothing to to do with any non-existent 'improved offers'.  He therefore proposed to quash his decision not to give Southwark its CPO and to hold another CPO inquiry.  His solicitor wrote to the leaseholders and interested parties, including the 35% Campaign, asking for their consent for this, while stating that in any event he would not appear at the scheduled High Court hearing on 9 May.  The leaseholders and interested parties had until 2 May to sign the consent, or continue the defence of a decision he had abandoned -  a difficult task. The leaseholders and interested parties understood that they should not discuss or publicise these proceedings until they were concluded, that to do otherwise would show a lack of courtesy to the courts.

Southwark had no such inhibitions, hence the press release, made before any submission to the High Court,and widely reported, with varying degrees of accuracy. 

As for SoS's decision itself, not to contest further Southwark's challenge, this rested on one ground - the so-called £16,000 policy.  This stipulated that all leaseholder's savings could be required, less £16,000, if they were to get a new home on a shared-ownership or shared equity basis.  After the CPO inquiry finished Southwark dropped this policy and asked the Secretary of State to take this into account in his consideration of their CPO application.  He did do so, writing to all parties for their views.  He concluded that it did not make any difference to his decision not to grant the CPO, referring to the CPO Inquiry inspector's report for reasons to justify this.  However, by logic, the Inspector's report could not supply such reasons, because the policy change only occurred after the inquiry closed.  An illogical decision cannot be lawful, so the Inspector gave way.   

The leaseholders and interested parties somewhat reluctantly signed the consent to quash the decision.  To do otherwise would have meant proving the SoS was wrong to say he was wrong or face ruinous costs.  It ensured that there would be another public inquiry and we remain fully confident that, having won once, we can win again.
