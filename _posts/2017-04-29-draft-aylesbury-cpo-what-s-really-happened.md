To paraphrase Winston Churchill - there are lies, there are damn lies and then there are Southwark Council press releases.

A choice example is the [triumphant annnouncement](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/news/2017/apr/secretary-of-state-overturns-previous-decision-regarding-aylesbury-estate-compulsory-purchase-orderof) of 27 April 2017, beginning with the headline _'Secretary of State overturns previous decision regarding Aylesbury estate compulsory purchase order'_.  It then neglects to give the Secretary of State's reason for this new decision, but says instead that improved offers had been made to the leaseholders, leaving the impression that this was why he changed his mind. The press release was the basis of a [number of media reports](/img/aylesburycpojrpress.pdf), which related the story with varying degrees of inaccuracy.

*Southwark's triumphant and misleading [press statement](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/news/2017/apr/secretary-of-state-overturns-previous-decision-regarding-aylesbury-estate-compulsory-purchase-order)*

The final paragraph of the press release notes that the _'Consent Order is being agreed with the Secretary of State’s lawyers and will be forwarded to the Interested Parties (Aylesbury leaseholders, their legal representatives and the 35% Campaign) shortly for their agreement'_. We had actually received the Consent Order on the 25 April, with a peremptory deadline for reply of the next day. This was extended to the 2 May, but it was obviously more important to Southwark to get out a press release out on the 27 April, than to have the courtesy of waiting for a reply, or indeed waiting for the High Court to actually quash the decision.

As for the SoS conceeding to Southwark's challenge - this was based on one single ground, arising from the so-called £16,000 policy. It had nothing at all to do with any non-existent 'improved offers'.   

The £16,000 policy stipulated that all a leaseholder's savings, less £16,000, would be required from them, if they were to get a new home on a shared-ownership or shared equity basis.  After the CPO inquiry finished, Southwark dropped this policy and asked the Secretary of State to take this into account in his consideration of their CPO application.  He did do so, writing to all parties for their views. In his [final decision letter](http://35percent.org/img/Decision_Letter_Final.pdf), he concluded _"in the light of the facts of this case,"_ that the policy change did not make any difference to his decision not to grant the CPO. (para. 7) 

Southwark hired a [big-gun QC](https://www.ftbchambers.co.uk/james-pereira-qc-compulsory-purchase-and-compensation) who argued on case law that the Secretary of State failed to provide adequate reasoning in relation to this aspect of his decision.  The Secretary of State conceded the appeal on this ground alone and this is made clear in the consent order. 

We have submitted a [formal complaint](/img/lbscomplaintaylesburycpo.pdf) asking Southwark to correct its press statement, but this latest episode in the Aylesbury CPO battle provides a neat cameo of how Southwark behaves in general. It only dropped the iniquitous £16,000 policy after the CPO inquiry concluded and to retrieve a decision it rightly feared was not going its way.  Shameless expenditure of public funds, expert lawyers and good fortune then rescued them, for the moment. It is a story that also illustrate why this is such an important battle - Southwark cannot be trusted to act fairly, plain and simple.

The leaseholders and interested parties have now somewhat reluctantly signed the Consent Order to quash the decision. To do otherwise would have required further costs and put layed ourselves open to potentially ruinous cost orders. But the Consent Order also has conditions, one being that there is another full public inquiry to hear the objectors' case and re-examine the merits of the scheme. We remain fully confident that, having won once, we can win again and .
