  Southwark receives just 10% share of profit from its joint venture with
  regeneration partner

Figures published in Lendlease's financial statements show that it made a whopping £132m profit from its __One the Elephant__ joint venture development with the Council. Despite owning the land, Southwark received just an £18.8m share and £4m in planning gain (payment in lieu of providing any affordable housing).

Lendlease's [latest half year results 2016](/img/lendleasehalfyearresults_2016.pdf) reveals that it sold all the homes in One the Elephant for a total of £209m ($A345m). All 284 units were pre-sold, many presumably overseas.  The three penthouses were sold for a total £8.3m.

One the Elephant was approved back in 2012 with no affordable housing.  Instead Lendlease paid £3.5m towards the £20m cost of the Castle leisure centre.  A viability assessment was submitted justifying the lack of affordable housing.  This gave a total scheme value of £134.9m, based on residential sales values of £638psf; One the Elephant's penthouses sold at £1447psf[^1].

Drafted by Savills, the viability assessment was appraised by the District Valuer's Service (who also appraised the Heygate Viability Assessment).  Both documents have been released, redacted, to the 35% Campaign following FOI requests.  Using the Dsitrict Valuer Service's (DVS) figures we have calculated that the total profit made by Lendlease is £139m.  Southwark Council recently announced, with fanfare, that it would be getting [£22m, as its share](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/news/2017/mar/council-confirms-22m-from-one-the-elephant-will-pay-for-leisure-centre). (£12.2m overage, £6.6m land sale, £3.5m S106)

As well as undervaluing the revenues the viability assessment has the usual curiosities. Profit is categorised as a cost, so achieving viability includes delivering a guaranteed profit - in this case a generous 25% on costs.  Lendlease submitted no build costs for two of the three scenarios considered, so the DVS had to supply its own.  Savills also makes an elementary howler, mistaking the policy compliant amount of social rented housing as 70% of the total affordable, not 50%, the correct amount.  Neither Southwark of the DVS appear to have noticed the error.  

Land values also show their customary elasticity, Savills set it at £12.5m, using a market value, contrary to Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyor's (RICS) guidance, who set the standard for these things.  The DVS set the value at £9m.  Southwark, by contrast, actually sold the land to Lendlease for £6.6m.

The land value is a critical factor in a viability assessment, because it goes towards the benchmark, which determines whether a scheme is viable or not; crudely the lower the land value, the larger the amount of affordable housing that can be supplied.  Both Savill's and the the DVS had to acknowlege that the land actually had a 'nominal' ie zero value , when applying RICS'S recommended 'existing user value' (EUV) method.  Zero value on the land is very unhelpful when you don't want to build affordable housing, so Savill's first strenously argues that purchase price should be used, but then covers all bases by using both zero EUV and a market price of £12.5m as a benchmark; fortunately both result in unviable schemes with no affordable housing.  We must remembernt hough that an unviable scheme does not mean an unprofitable scheme - it means one that does not give at least 25% profit.

In fact it suited both Southwark and Lendlease not to have affordable housing in One the Elephant. Southwark [sacrificed a new leisure centre](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieDecisionDetails.aspx?AIId=8877), plus [the MUSCo](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s10891/Elephant%20and%20Castle%20-%20Regeneration%20Agreement%20and%20Disposal%20of%20Associated%20Land%20-%20Report.pdf), to secure the 2007 Regeneration Agreement with Lendlease and was willing to sacrifice affordable housing in turn, to make good the loss.  On Lend Lease's side, the viability assessment notes that having on-site affordable housing would 'have a negative impact on the value of the private units' and would require a 2.5% reduction in the price; paying £3.5m towards a leisure centre right on it's doorstep saved Lendlease from this expedient and gained it over £5m, calculated on total revenue of £209m.  The only people who lost out were those who need affordable housing.   

 

What should humiliate Southwark is not that they are getting stuffed but that they even boast about it in a press release.


For the attention of Dave Hill....
The usual viability assessment curiousities

The [FVA](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/374643/response/921669/attach/3/170116%20St%20Marys%20Viability%20Assessment%20003%203%20Redacted.pdf) for 'One the Elephant' shows an estimated GDV of £134m

But the [Lendlease half year results 2016](/img/lendleasehalfyearresults_2016.pdf) shows that One the Elephant was 100% presold with a sales revenue of $345AUD (£206m)
http://www.lendlease.com/-/media/llcom/investor-relations/asx-announcements/2016/17022016-lendlease-delivers-double-digit-earnings-growth.ashx

So pre-sales alone provided Lendlease with £206 - nearly twice their estimated GDV.

Meanwhile, One the Elephant cost £79m to build: [half year report 2016](/img/lendleasehalfyearreport_2016.pdf)

Paragraph 7.3.2 of the FVA also estimates the market value of the site to be £12.5m - but the site was sold to Lendlease for half this (£6.5m).

The FVA also lists 'other S106 contributions' as totalling £4.6m, but the officers report says just £2.6m for the E&C Transport tariff with other contributions provided in lieu.

Above link also says: _"The group's British Haringey development was also well progressed and Mr McCann said affordable housing would be part of that project's composition. There will be affordable housing – it is to be worked through with the government. What happens now is that we sit down with the government and agree a development agreement that will incorporate all the commitments to affordable housing."_

We point out that Lendlease's contractual agreement with Southwark bound Lendlease into providing 300 'social rented' homes - in the event it is only providing 82. Any lawyer will tell you that a contractual agreement is worth nothing if a party is not willing to enforce it.

[^1]: See [Land Registry deeds](/img/lrdeeds_otepenthouses.pdf) for the 3 penthouses, which show these were sold for a total of £8.3m. The [brochure](/img/oteskyscapecollection.pdf) shows that the 3 penthouses comprise a total of 5,723 sqft - this gives average sales revenue of £1,447 per sqft across the 3 penthouses.
