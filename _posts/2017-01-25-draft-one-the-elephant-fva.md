The [FVA](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/374643/response/921669/attach/3/170116%20St%20Marys%20Viability%20Assessment%20003%203%20Redacted.pdf) for 'One the Elephant' shows an estimated GDV of £134m

But the [Lendlease half year results 2016](/img/lendleasehalfyearresults_2016.pdf) shows that One the Elephant was 100% presold with a sales revenue of $345AUD (£206m)

So pre-sales alone provided Lendlease with £206 - nearly twice their estimated GDV.

Meanwhile, One the Elephant cost £79m to build: [half year report 2016](/img/lendleasehalfyearreport_2016.pdf)

Paragraph 7.3.2 of the FVA also estimates the market value of the site to be £12.5m - but the site was sold to Lendlease for half this (£6.5m).

The FVA also lists 'other S106 contributions' as totalling £4.6m, but the officers report says just £2.6m for the E&C Transport tariff with other contributions provided in lieu.
