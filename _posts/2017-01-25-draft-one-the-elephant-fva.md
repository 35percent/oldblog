Figures published in Lendlease's 2016 half year [financial statement](http://www.lendlease.com/-/media/llcom/investor-relations/asx-announcements/2016/17022016-lendlease-delivers-double-digit-earnings-growth.ashx) and 2015 [portfolio report](http://www.lendlease.com/-/media/llcom/investor-relations/asx-announcements/2016/17022016-2016-half-year-results-portfolio-report.ashx)
show that it made a handsome £101m profit from its __One the Elephant__ joint venture development with the Council. Despite owning the land, Southwark received just [£22m](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/news/2017/mar/council-confirms-22m-from-one-the-elephant-will-pay-for-leisure-centre) which includes £3.5m towards the £20m cost of the leisure centre. This was in lieu of providing any affordable housing.

Lendlease's [financial statement](http://www.lendlease.com/-/media/llcom/investor-relations/asx-announcements/2016/17022016-lendlease-delivers-double-digit-earnings-growth.ashx) reveals that it sold all the homes in One the Elephant for a total of £209m ($A345m). All 284 units were pre-sold, many presumably overseas.  The three penthouses were sold for a total £8.3m.  Construction and other costs total £108m [^1].


One the Elephant was approved back in 2012 with no affordable housing.  A [viability assessment](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/374643/response/921669/attach/3/170116%20St%20Marys%20Viability%20Assessment%20003%203%20Redacted.pdf) was submitted justifying the lack of affordable housing.  This gave a total scheme value of £134.9m based on residential sales values of £638psf; in the event the apartments sold for an average of £1,033 psf. One the Elephant's penthouses sold at £1447psf[^2].

Drafted by Savills, the viability assessment was appraised by the District Valuer's Service (who also appraised the Heygate Viability Assessment).  Both documents have been released, redacted, to the 35% Campaign following FOI requests. 

As well as undervaluing the revenues the viability assessment has the usual curiosities. Lendlease required a minimum profit of 25% on cost - between £20-£26m depending the amount of affordable housing. This in turn produced a deficit of £12.5m for a scheme with no affordable housing and a deficit of £25.9m with 35% affordable housing.

In the event, the £101m that Lendlease has made is at least four times the figure that was put in to the viability assessment.

Land values also show their customary elasticity, Savills set it at £12.5m, using a market value, contrary to Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyor's (RICS) guidance, who set the standard for these things.  The DVS set the value at £9m.  Southwark, by contrast, actually [sold the land](http://35percent.org/img/LRegisterOneTheElephant.pdf) to Lendlease for £6.6m.

The land value is a critical factor in a viability assessment, because it goes towards the benchmark, which determines whether a scheme is viable or not; crudely the lower the land value, the larger the amount of affordable housing that can be supplied.  Both Savill's and the the DVS had to acknowlege that the land actually had a 'nominal' ie zero value , when applying RICS'S recommended 'existing user value' (EUV) method.  Zero value on the land is very unhelpful when you don't want to build affordable housing.

In fact it suited both Southwark and Lendlease not to have affordable housing in One the Elephant. Southwark [had to remove the new leisure centre](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieDecisionDetails.aspx?AIId=8877) and [the MUSCo](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s10891/Elephant%20and%20Castle%20-%20Regeneration%20Agreement%20and%20Disposal%20of%20Associated%20Land%20-%20Report.pdf), before Lendlease would sign the [2010 Regeneration Agreement].

Southwark was now willing to sacrifice affordable housing in turn, to make good the loss.  On Lendlease's side, the viability assessment notes that having on-site affordable housing would _'have a negative impact on the value of the private units'_ and would require a 2.5% reduction in the price; paying £3.5m towards a leisure centre right on its doorstep saved Lendlease from this expedient and gained it over £5m[^3].

There are two conclusions to be drawn from this sorry tale; Southwark is no match for developers in these joint ventures; the money it is getting might look good in a press release, but it's the developer who is walking away with the lion's share. Second, viability assessments are useless, they don't capture the full value created by these enormous gold-panelled towers and it is nonsense to claim that they don't turn enough profit to give us any affordable housing.

The [brochure](/img/oteskyscapecollection.pdf) shows that the 3 penthouses comprise a total of 5,723 sqft - this gives average sales revenue of £1,447 per sqft across the 3 penthouses.
