Southwark Council is set to approve a mixed-used residential scheme in the Old Kent Rd Opportunity Area with no social rented housing or family housing, at its [planning meeting on 6 Oct](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=119&MId=6678&Ver=4).

[The proposed development](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=documents&keyVal=Q3J511KB03Q00) on Ossory Rd is for 105 units of housing, with light industrial space beneath this.  All 105 units will be affordable housing, but of the most expensive type, sold at 80% market value.  The applicant is [Pocket Living](https://www.pocketliving.com/), which specialises in maximising the amount of housing on small sites.  All the homes will be one-bed, one person units, without family housing.  This is the  the second such Pocket Living development in the area; the first, in [Varcoe Rd](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?keyVal=ZZZV0WKBWR623&activeTab=summary) had 57 units and a third, [Credon House](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=documents&keyVal=Q2TJM2KBKZ000), also for 57 units is in the pipeline.

## Pocket Living make up their own rules

Southwark Council requires 35% affordable housing, half of which should be social rented, on all developments of this size.  This has been the case since 2007 and the requirement has been retained in a succession of local planning documents, up to the [draft New Southwark Plan](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning-policy-and-transport-policy/new-southwark-plan) and the [Old Kent Rd Area Action Plan](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning-policy-and-transport-policy/development-plan/area-action-plans-section/old-kent-road-aap).  All [major approved developments](https://oldkentroad.org.uk/keydevelopments) within the Old Kent Rd have pledged to deliver that amount.

There should also be at least 20% family housing of 3, 4, 5-beds in major developments and 60% of should comprise 2-bed homes.

Pocket Living, however, want to make up their own rules.  Their sites are small and it wishes to maximise the number of homes built, so they are all one -bed/one person [though 10% of their occupants are couples](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/files/49DC49BD88B13B7B1434CD39C64C23BC/pdf/20_AP_0009-DESIGN_AND_ACCESS_STATEMENT_PART_1-830493.pdf) (pg 9 D&A statement), with most units [barely above the minimum size](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s90901/Report%202-10%20OSSORY%20ROAD%20LONDON%20SE1%205PA.pdf) allowed (37 sq metres) (OR Table pg 42).

The amount of open and amenity space for occupants is also squeezed.  There should be 1,050 sqm private amenity space, Pocket are providing a miniscule 42 sqm.  Developers can compensate for a lack of private space with more communal space, but Pocket falls well short here, too, providing [less than half the amount](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s90901/Report%202-10%20OSSORY%20ROAD%20LONDON%20SE1%205PA.pdf) required (506 sqm instead of 1,058 sqm; OR 133,134).

## Not that affordable

Pocket Living justify their radical departures from Southwark’s affordable housing requirements, by claiming they are serving the hard-pressed, young first-time buyer and supply their own statistics and census figures to back this up, dutifully reproduced by the [officer’s report](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s90901/Report%202-10%20OSSORY%20ROAD%20LONDON%20SE1%205PA.pdf) (OR 112), which recommends approval of the scheme.

Buying a decent home in London is undoubtedly hard for the young professionals Pocket Living housing is squarely aimed at, but they are still, relatively speaking, much better off than those excluded by the absence of social and family housing from Pocket Living developments.  Pocket’s typical purchaser will have an average income of £44,000 (OR60), an income enjoyed by [less than 4.5% of Southwark’s households](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/assets/attach/11656/NSP01-New-Southwark-Plan-Submission-Version-Proposed-Modifications-for-Examination.pdf) (Fig 2).   Supplying homes at 80% market value to those who earn this amount, at the [expense of those who earn barely half](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/assets/attach/11656/NSP01-New-Southwark-Plan-Submission-Version-Proposed-Modifications-for-Examination.pdf) that (NSP Submission Version Jan 2020 Fig 2) is not what affordable housing should be about.
