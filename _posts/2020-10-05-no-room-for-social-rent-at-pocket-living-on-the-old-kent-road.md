Southwark Council is set to approve a mixed-used residential scheme in the Old Kent Rd Opportunity Area with no social rented housing or family housing, at its [planning meeting on 6 Oct](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=119&MId=6678&Ver=4).

[The proposed development](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=documents&keyVal=Q3J511KB03Q00) on Ossory Rd is for 105 units of housing, with light industrial space beneath this.  All 105 units will be affordable housing, but of the most expensive type, sold at 80% market value.  The applicant is [Pocket Living](https://www.pocketliving.com/), which specialises in maximising the amount of housing on small sites.  All the homes will be one-bed, one person units, without family housing.  This is the  the second such Pocket Living development in the area; the first, in [Varcoe Rd](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?keyVal=ZZZV0WKBWR623&activeTab=summary) had 57 units and a third, [Credon House](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=documents&keyVal=Q2TJM2KBKZ000), also for 57 units is in the pipeline.

## Pocket Living make up their own rules

Southwark Council requires 35% affordable housing, half of which should be social rented, on all developments of this size.  This has been the case since 2007 and the requirement has been retained in a succession of local planning documents, up to the [draft New Southwark Plan](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning-policy-and-transport-policy/new-southwark-plan) and the [Old Kent Rd Area Action Plan](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning-policy-and-transport-policy/development-plan/area-action-plans-section/old-kent-road-aap).  All [major approved developments](https://oldkentroad.org.uk/keydevelopments) within the Old Kent Rd have pledged to deliver that amount.
