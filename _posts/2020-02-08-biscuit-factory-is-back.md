title: Biscuit factory is back
---
## A New Post
We [previously blogged](http://35percent.org/2018-09-25-grosvenor-taking-the-biscuit-factory/) about biscuit factory which was rejected by Southwark.

After the Mayor overrode Southwark's decision and called it in, he is set to approve the scheme on 21st Febuarya. 

Back with an increase number of homes to 1,548. Previously there were no social rented homes proposed.

This time there are 140 homes proposed at social rent equivalent.

This still falls short of Southwark's policy requirement.

What the hell is the Mayor doing?
