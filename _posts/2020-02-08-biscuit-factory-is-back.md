## A New Post
We [previously blogged](http://35percent.org/2018-09-25-grosvenor-taking-the-biscuit-factory/) about biscuit factory.

Developer Grovesnor estate proposed Build to Rent xxxx units with no social housing.  proved too much for both local councillors and planning committee, who rejected the scheme.

After the Mayor overrode Southwark's decision and called it in, he is set to approve the scheme on 21st Febuarya. Cited Southwark's failure to meet houisng targets as reason (lnk).

New proposal. Still BtR,now 1548 units (greater density) with fake social rented housing - social rent equivalent;3 year tenancy; rent? FOI, our estimate from viability assessment - GLA won't say, wait until s106 is approved (consultation conducted on this basis).  Covenant length? 
Back with an increase number of homes to 1,548. Previously there were no social rented homes proposed.

This time there are 140 homes proposed at social rent equivalent.  Under Southwark's local plan we shold get c 380 proper s/rent, based on units.

(Another) non-viable development. Whatever confidence there might be in viability undermined by hugh disparity in figures - in 2017 planning application £189m loss (Grosvnor); £10m profit (Southwark; now £xm (not agreed by GLA?).  Review?

Officer's report 5 working days, hearing 21 Feb 

This still falls short of Southwark's policy requirement. Southwark Plan and London Plan both moving in same direction - support for BtR, fake social rent and less off it.

What the hell is the Mayor doing?  Mayor cited Southwark's failure to meet housing targets; justifiable, but his concern is headline figures, hopes that no-one will notice what kind of aff/h. Need for social housing (Southwark table, ward indices); Mayor's pre-election promises on social housing. Tradeable commodity. Mayor likes - institutional finance.
