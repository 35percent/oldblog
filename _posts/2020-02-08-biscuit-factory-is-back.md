title: Biscuit factory is back
---
We [previously blogged](http://35percent.org/2018-09-25-grosvenor-taking-the-biscuit-factory/) about biscuit factory.

The world's richest man (under 30 - worth over £10bn) Hugh Grosvenor the 7th Duke of Westminster and the [largest landowner in London](https://whoownsengland.org/2017/10/28/who-owns-central-london/), proposed Build to Rent xxxx units with no social housing. This proved too much for both local councillors and planning committee, who rejected the scheme.

After the Mayor overrode Southwark's decision and called it in, he is set to approve the scheme on 21st Febuarya. Cited Southwark's failure to meet houisng targets as reason (lnk).

New proposal. Still BtR,now 1548 units (greater density) with fake social rented housing - social rent equivalent;3 year tenancy; rent? FOI, our estimate from viability assessment - GLA won't say, wait until s106 is approved (consultation conducted on this basis).  Covenant length? 
Back with an increase number of homes to 1,548. Previously there were no social rented homes proposed.

This time there are 140 homes proposed at social rent equivalent.  Under Southwark's local plan we shold get c 380 proper s/rent, based on units.

(Another) non-viable development. Whatever confidence there might be in viability undermined by hugh disparity in figures - in 2017 planning application £189m loss (Grosvnor); £101m profit (Southwark; now Grosvenor claim the profit will be £13m (not agreed by GLA?).  This falls below Grosvenor own profit target of xxx% IRR and so classes the develoment as  non-viable.  Does it qualify for the fast track? (H6) Review? Yes - Stage 2 report.  This is justification for an affordable housing offer that still does not meet Southwark's policy requirements (adopted or emerging).

Officer's report 5 working days, hearing 21 Feb 

This still falls short of Southwark's policy requirement. Southwark Plan and London Plan both moving in same direction - support for BtR, fake social rent and less off it.

Cllr Johnson Situ, Southwark's regeneration boss [said](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/oct/26/grosvenor-1bn-bermondsey-build-to-rent-project-in-jeopardy-duke-of-westminster-property-group) about the previous application:_"With over 10,000 people on our housing waiting list it is very disappointing to see such a little amount of social or genuinely affordable housing in this application. As it stands, we are still a long way from agreeing a scheme that meets the council’s policies."_

The scheme is still 240 social rented homes away from meeting the council's policies so why has Cllr Situ now dropped his opposition to the scheme and what the hell is the Mayor doing?  Mayor cited Southwark's failure to meet housing targets; justifiable, but his concern is headline figures, hopes that no-one will notice what kind of aff/h. Need for social housing (Southwark table, ward indices); Mayor's pre-election promises on social housing. Tradeable commodity. Mayor likes - institutional finance.
