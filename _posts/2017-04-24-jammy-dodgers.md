The Chief Executive Officer and founder of Galliards, one of Britain’s leading property developers, is a beneficiary of an allegedly _"fraudulent"_ scheme to sell affordable housing to offshore investors, according to court documents and corporate filings uncovered by the [35% campaign](http://35percent.org) and [OurCity.London](http://ourcity.london).

The fraud is alleged by Southwark Council in a [High Court claim](http://35percent.org/img/2016poc.pdf) and involves 27 affordable homes in three housing developments in the borough.  Galliard founder, Steven Conway, is [listed](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/officers/p--y1bVdFV0XhrlVzfLKQoAhi0c/appointments) at Companies House as either a director, shareholder, member or former director of four companies involved in alleged ‘conspiracies’ at two of the sites[^1]. Mr Conway is not cited as a defendant in the claim. 

The story has come to light after our [investigation](http://35percent.org/2016-12-12-ombudsman-slams-southwark-for-no-s106-monitoring/) into S106 monitoring failures and [FOI requests](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/hartleys_jam_factory_redevelopme) to Southwark Council, which revealed the legal action against the [London District Housing Association](http://www.londondha.com/) and over 30 other defendants. The four alleged conspiracies took place at the Jam Factory at Tower Bridge, South City Court in Peckham and Wanley Rd, Camberwell. Southwark is seeking up to £15m in damages.

## London District Housing Association
Southwark alleges that the __London District Housing Association (LDHA)__ is at the centre of the conspiracies scam. __LDHA__, whose head office overlooks the Jam Factory, aggressively pursues every new development in zones 1-4, according to an industry source. Their [board report] claims they have placed 2500 units under offer in central London and have secured units in Southwark, Camden, Greenwich and other London boroughs. Formerly the __Faithland Housing Association__, __LDHA__ is not on the latest social landlord register. Their website claims that they provide housing for service personal and key workers, giving particular emphasis to BME applicants.

__LDHA__ chair Phillip Butt and __LDHA__ director Sehaer Siddique, are former officers at Lambeth Living, Lambeth Council's housing management company. According to its Articles of Association, __Faithland Housing Association__ was incorporated at the same address as __Trademark Group__'s head office on Long Lane in Bermondsey. The address is located at Trademark's [__City Walk__ development](http://www.trademarkgroup.co.uk/portfolio/city-walk-london-se1-4pp/) that it developed in conjuction with a shell company called __Northcover Ltd__, of which Stephen Conway is [listed](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/04070460/officers) as a director. 

## How the scam works
Southwark council alleges that there were four conspiracies to put affordable housing onto the private market - two at the Jam Factory, one each at South City Central and Wanley St. All the conspiracies took a similar form. LDHA gained legal control of the affordable housing through a S106 agreement with Southwark, while their purchase cost was financed by a group of property and investment companies called PGP Companies.

After securing the properties, the Council's court claim [documents](http://35percent.org/img/2016poc.pdf) allege that the PGP companies 'conspired' with LDHA to _'recruit'_ individuals to be the supposed _'nominees'_ for the affordable housing shared ownership leases. The nominees would hold the properties 'on trust' for the PGP companies, who had control of the flats. Southwark alleges that the nominees were not eligible for affordable housing, had no intention of occupying the homes as such and were paid a fee for the use of their names.

Having taken control of the flats the PGP companies either let them out at market rents, or immediately staircased out the property (ie moved them from shared ownership to 100% ownership) and then sold them on, ‘at full market price’, making a substantial profit.

The Protected Growth Plan companies receive a cut of the profits having financed the deal.

## The Jam Factory Conspiracy
The ‘Jam Factory Conspiracy’ is one of the two alleged conspiracies on the Jam Factory site and involves Flats 1 to 9. 

According to Southwark’s court documents in October 2010 LDHA bought the 18 Jam Factory affordable housing units including Flats 1-9, for £97,000 per unit, using a loan from PGP Securities No.5 LLP. Under the terms of the s106 agreement, LDHA had to offer the flats as part-buy/part rent shared ownership properties or for affordable rent.

In 2013 LDHA issued 125 year leases for the flats to a group of nominees. The nominees then immediately granted a power of attorney over the flats to a PGP company called PGP Jam Factory Limited. The court documents allege that the nominees had no need for affordable housing, had homes elsewhere and never intended to occupy the housing.

The leases differed from the normal shared ownership leases in that they did not give the right of first refusal to the housing association to buy back the home if it was sold at a later date.
On granting control to the nominees the flats were ‘staircased’ out by March 2014, meaning that the shared ownership was transferred to 100% ownership. Usually this happens by the occupant of the shared ownership flat buying the rest of the share of ownership from the social landlord. If these transactions were genuine it would have meant the owners finding hundreds of thousands of pounds to buy their flat outright within months of qualifying for affordable housing. According to Southwark Council, this staircasing was a ‘sham’.

In July 2014, the nominees for flats 1-9, acting on the direction of PGP Jam Factory Limited, sold their leases. Land registry documents do not disclose the sales price. Southwark Council believes the sales prices to be in the region of £280,000, which is substantially below the market rate.

The flats were sold to a company called Hartley Apartments limited, using money borrowed from another company called Silverstream Finance (Hampsted) Limited. Silverstream is in turn financed by an Israeli Bank, Leumi, who according to documents on companies house appear to control the Jam Factory flats.

Hartley, together with others then proceed to market the apartments on the open market. In doing so they advertise them as being part of ‘exclusive gated development’ and ‘perfect for city commuters and socialites alike’. One flat, flat 5, is sold to a Chinese investor, Wai Kwan Lily Lai, for £404,000.

LDHA made a loan agreement with PGP Securities No.5 LLP that allowed it to buy the Jam Factory flats. This agreement had no regular interest payments, but took instead the form of a percentage of the profit made on the sale of any properties. As a ‘limited liability partnership’ (LLP) this profit would be distributed to the partners. (NB Partners are not responsible for each other’s actions).

The amount of profit on the sale that PGP Securities No. 5 was entitled to was large, only being capped at 20% per annum.

## A Trademark Scam
Southwark’s court claim alleges that a central figure in the conspiracies is Terry McMillan, director of Trademark Group Ltd. The Trademark Group owns ‘Protected Growth Plan Limited’ which in turn controls the PGP companies at the centre of the conspiracies. Mr McMillan is cited in the court documents as arranging for flats to be staircased out, directing the nominees, and marketing the flats on the open market. Trademark shares directors (and registered addresses/accountants) with LDHA[^2].

According to its [website](http://www.trademarkgroup.co.uk), Trademark has delivered 4300 homes across 12 developments, all of which in Southwark - including Galliard's [Marcia St](http://www.trademarkgroup.co.uk/portfolio/marcia-road-london-se1-5xf/) development, Galliard's [City Walk](http://www.trademarkgroup.co.uk/portfolio/city-walk-london-se1-4pp/) scheme, the [Bacon Factory](http://www.trademarkgroup.co.uk/portfolio/the-bacon-factory-great-suffolk-street-london-se1-0bd/) and the [Canada Water regeneration](http://www.trademarkgroup.co.uk/portfolio/surrey-quays-leisure-centre-se16/).
