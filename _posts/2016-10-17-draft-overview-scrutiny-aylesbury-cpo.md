The [Aylesbury estate Leaseholders Group](http://halag.wordpress.com) staged a protest at the Council's Overview & Scrutiny Committee meeting on Monday. They protested at the Council's [decision](http://35percent.org/2016-09-26-council-appeals-aylesbury-cpo-decision/) to appeal the Secretary of State's [damning judgement](http://35percent.org/2016-09-18-aylesbury-compulsory-purchase-order-rejected/) that their equalities/human rights were being breached.

The leaseholders made a [written submission](https://halag.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/oscdeputation_10102016.pdf) and gave evidence to the Committee, asserting that the High Court challenge was uneccessary. Having been [accused](http://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/aylesbury-plan-face-scrutiny/) of 'holding the Council to ransom', the leaseholders pointed out that all they wanted was to remain homeowners in the borough.They reminded the Council of its like-for-like rehousing offer and its mysterious disappearance from the list of options available to them early on in the scheme. Like-for-like being a simple swap for a similar size flat on a council estate elsewhere in the borough. 

Council members came up with some questionable excuses as to why the like-for-like policy was dropped and insisted the best course of action was to challenge the Secretary of State's decision and continue shortchanging leaseholders.

The committee also heard that the Council has spent a total of £200k on the Aylesbury CPO inquiry to date and that it estimates a further £50k is required in order to mount the High Court challenge. It was not able to give an estimate of costs it would become liable for should it lose the High Court battle and be forced to pay the Secretary of State's legal fees and court costs. 

The meeting also heard that the decision to mount the legal challenge was taken by its 'monitoring officer' Doreen Forrester-Brown and that the Overview & Scrutiny Committee is powerless to refer the decision to democratically elected members because it was a delegated officer decision in the first place. 

The most vocal of members on the Scrutiny committee was Southwark's only Corbynite Councillor Paul Fleming, who instead of scrutinising the Council's decision to appeal against the Secretary of State, scrutinised the decision to call it in. Councillor Fleming is a [homeowner](http://35percent.org/img/LR_163MerrowSt.pdf) on the [privatised](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2006/jan/18/keyworkerhousing.communities) Octavia Hill estate overlooking the Aylesbury. He is a ward Councillor for the Aylesbury estate and a [vehement proponent](http://pwfpwfpwf.blogspot.co.uk/2015/03/the-aylesbury-estate-utopia-when.html) of demolition. He is Southwark’s only Councillor to [describe himself](http://pwfpwfpwf.blogspot.co.uk/2016/06/why-i-have-no-choice-but-to-keepcorbyn.html) as both a Jacobite and a Corbynite and to [publicly endorse](http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/8825) Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership. He is also one of only two Labour Councillors in Southwark to have actively [campaigned for Brexit](http://pwfpwfpwf.blogspot.co.uk/2016/04/brexit-constructive-case-to-leave.html) (of the Lexit variety).
  
Cllr Fleming went on to defend the monitoring officer's decision to appeal against the Secretary of State's decision, explaining the Council's main [grounds of appeal](http://35percent.org/img/20161007_Secretary_of_State_Aylesbury_CPO.pdf), which is that the Inspector failed to take into account the fact that the Council had made improvements to it re-housing offer to leaseholders. What Councillor Fleming didn't explain is that these changes to leaseholder rehousing policy were made two months after the public inquiry had closed and that [inquiry rules] state that new evidence cannot be submitted by either party after a public inquiry has closed. This is for the obvious practical reasons. He also dismissed the leaseholders' request for like-for-like swaps as 'privatising council housing'.

The second of the Council's two arguments listed in its [grounds of appeal](http://35percent.org/img/20161007_Secretary_of_State_Aylesbury_CPO.pdf) to the High Court, is that it claims none of the objectors at the inquiry raised the issue of overshadowing.

A cursory glance through the witness evidence from the inquiry shows that the Council's claim is incorrect. Overshadowing was indeed raised by at least one of the objectors - none other than Piers Corbyn, brother of Jeremry and former ward Councillor for the estate. Here is the audio clip of Piers raising the overshadowing issue (amongst others).

In addition, the inspector was provided with full copies of all the objections received by the Council to the planning application, many of which raised the issue of overshadowing.
 
As objectors who made representations to the public inquiry we have applied to become an interested party in the Council's application to appeal. We will be submitting representations to the High Court, including a full copy of Piers Corbyn's witness evidence and other evidence showing Southwark's claim to be unfounded and simply a desperate attempt to...
