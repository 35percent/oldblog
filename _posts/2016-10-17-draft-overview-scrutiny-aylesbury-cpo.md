At last night's 'call-in' meeting by the Overview and Scrutiny Committee, Cabinet member Mark Williams confirmed that the Council had spent a total of £200k on the Aylesbury CPO inquiry and that it will cost a further £50k to mount the High Court challenge. He explained that this would be a cheaper option than having to pay more compensation to each of the remaining leaseholders. He followed this up by re-iterating all the usual arguments about how he has a duty to the public purse and made a point of explaining that these funds were not coming from Council tax payers but from the Council's Housing Revenue account; i.e. the rent paid by the borough's Council tenants.

Cllr Williams also confirmed that the viability of the Aylesbury regeneration and other regeneration schemes depended on challenging the Secretary of State's decision; i.e. paying the leaseholders compensation based on independent market value valuations would render the scheme unviable. 

We blogged [previously] about the mysterious budget slashing in the run up to approval of the Area Action Plan for the estate.. 
Judi's [FOI request](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/352116/response/873296/attach/3/160926%20EIR%20FOI%20685920.pdf)




The meeting also confirmed that the decision to mount the legal challenge lies was taken by its 'monitoring officer' Doreen Forrester-Brown and that no agreement by Council members was necessary.

The most vocal of members on the Scrutiny committee was Southwark momentum councillor Paul Fleming, who instead of scrutinising the Council's decision to appeal against the Secretary of State, decided to scrutinise .. He also dismissed the leaseholders' request for like-for-like swaps as 'privatising council housing'.

Cllr Fleming who is also ward Councillor for the Aylesbury estate, bought a terraced house overlooking the next phase of the regeneration scheme.
He was the only person to speak in support of the scheme at the planning application hearing for the Aylesbury redevelopment.

Cllr Lury absent - staircased in less than a year.

Grounds for appeal published - we have applied to be an interested party in the case.

### do you know where I could find a basic outline of the finances of the Aylesbury regeneration?

Some of the basic financials are laid out here: http://35percent.org/aylesbury-estate/#bridging-the-viability-gap
and in this blog post: http://35percent.org/2016-09-26-council-appeals-aylesbury-cpo-decision/#the-business-case-for-a-moratorium

### I think I've understood from your posts that you're saying Southwark Council have said it would cost them £150 million to decant residents and knock down the estate. Is that for the whole estate or just the first development phase?

The whole estate
 
### And you're saying that it will end up being much more than that, right?

£47m of this has already been spent and a further £52m committed before the first development site has even been demolished.
See this blog post for more info on these figures: http://35percent.org/2016-09-26-council-appeals-aylesbury-cpo-decision/#the-business-case-for-a-moratorium

### Are there figures out there on how much Notting Hill plans to spend on building the new blocks?

Construction and associated costs are estimated at £888m in the viability figures we obtained via FOI. It gets a bit more complicated because Notting Hill has an agreement with developers Barratt homes who are actually the ones building the new homes. I understand from the redacted Development Partnership Agreement that Barratt will foot most of the construction costs in return for being able to keep half of the sales revenue on the sale of the private units up to an agreed price per square ft (£451 per square ft).
 
### And what about the land, do Southwark just sell it to Notting Hill or do they keep owning it?

Southwark is selling the entire estate to Notting Hill. The Council will receive payments from Notting Hill in return for selling the land but these will be dependent on the viability of each individual phase; i.e. after each phase is completed the total construction costs (plus a 21% profit margin for Notting Hill - [included as a cost]) are deducted from the total sales revenue, and whatever is left over the Council receives as a land receipt for the sale of the Land.
The Council also has a profit share agreement with Notting Hill, whereby it receives 50% of the sales profit if sales exceed a given benchmark (£472 per square ft).
