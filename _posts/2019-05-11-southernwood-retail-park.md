Viability has become a thing in planning since several [high profile](olly wainwright article) cases of developers using viability assessments to avoid affordable housing led to [campaigning](/viability-assessments) and [changes in policy].   

One of the things that Developers hate most about the new policy requirements is something called a 'late stage review mechanism'. 

This is where developers are forced to disclose in detail the actual costs spent, revenue received and profit made from a scheme in order for a local authority to be able to 'claw back' surplus profit to fulfil affordable housing obligations.

There is a complicated set of planning policy requirements that developers need to navigate in order to avoid a late stage review mechanism and here is how they are currently doing it:

## Step 1: Submit a planning application that offers 35% affordable housing 
This puts developers on a 'Fast Track' route  allowing them to avoid a late stage review mechanism.

## Step 2: Avoid having to apply for grant funding
The Mayor's planning policy requires all schemes to investigate the availability of public subsidy in order to maximise affordable housing provision (para 2.5) of the [Affordable Housing SPG](https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/planning/implementing-london-plan/planning-guidance-and-practice-notes/affordable-housing-and-viability-supplementary-planning-guidance-spg)

But by accompanying a planning application with a viability assessment saying that 35% affordable is being offered despite 0% being the maximum viable amount, the developer is able to avoid the grant funding available under paragraph 52 of the [Mayor's funding guidance](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/homesforlondoners-affordablehomesprogrammefundingguidance.pdf) and invoke paragraph 80 which requires at least 40% affordable housing provision to be eligible for any grant funding.

This then enables the developer argue that the conversion of 5% of its private homes to affordable housing (difference between 35% and 40%) would render the scheme less viable because of the 'gap' between the high value private sales and low value affordale units (- lead in to the case of Southernwood retail park.)

[Land Registry deeds](35percent.org/lrdeeds/SouthernwoodRetailPark.pdf) show that Glasgow City Council as the owner behind the gigantic Southernwood Retail Park up for approval on xxxx.

This clearly invokes [Paragraph A(4) of Policy of H5 of the London Plan](https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/planning/london-plan/new-london-plan/draft-new-london-plan/chapter-4-housing/policy-h5-delivering-affordable-housing) which requires 'public sector land delivering at least 50 per cent affordable housing'.

The planning committee report fudges the question of the higher threshold for public sector land:

Grant funding hasn't been applied for. Bizzarely the viability assessment for the scheme claims that grant funding would make it less viable...

Additional cost
GE’s appraisal incorporates £4.7 million of additional costs which are identified as confidential for
commercial reasons.

£785 per square foot sales estimate - current day values and as BNP Paribas points out based on sales on ex-local authority flats on surrounding estates. No consideration that it will be next to a zone 1 Bakerloo line tube station. Scheme will pay just £2m in Mayoral CIL, presumably towards cost of tube station.
