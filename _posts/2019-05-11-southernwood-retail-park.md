Viability

Viability assessments have become notorious as a means used by developers to [avoid meeting](https://england.shelter.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/1434439/2017.11.01_Slipping_through_the_loophole.pdf) their affordable housing obligations. The assessments purport to show that the requirements laid down by local authorities cannot be met without rendering the scheme financially unviable and thus undeliverable, leading to the affordable housing requirement being reduced  

Over the past few years housing [campaigners](/viability-assessments)and several [high profile](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jun/25/london-developers-viability-planning-affordable-social-housing-regeneration-oliver-wainwright) cases have managed to shed some light on this dark art how, leading to [changes in policy](https://www.insidehousing.co.uk/home/home/london-borough-makes-viability-assessments-public-54133) and greater scrutiny of developer's viability claims.

In Southwark this had meant we are starting [to get 35% affordable housing](examples) that we have been denied until now.  But while developers are offering 35% affordable housing, they continue to insist that their scemes are unviable.  Southernwood Retail Park is a case in point.  Here the developer (Glasgow City Council) claims that they will only make 2.24% profit on Gross Development Value (GDV); Southwark's consultants beg to differ and say 16.37% can be made.  Both figures fall short of the developer's profit target (set by themselves) of 18.84%, so the development is officially 'unviable',  Nonetheless the developer says that they will deliver 35% affordable housing, 25% social rent, 10% intermediate, in line with local housing policy.  

One of the things that Developers hate most about the new policy requirements is something called a 'late stage review mechanism'. 

This is where developers are forced to disclose in detail the actual costs spent, revenue received and actual profit made from a scheme in order for a local authority to be able to 'claw back' additional affordable housing.

There is a complicated set of planning policy requirements that developers need to navigate in order to avoid a late stage review mechanism and here is how they are currently doing it:

## Step 1: Submit a planning application that offers 35% affordable housing 
This puts developers on a 'Fast Track' route  allowing them to avoid a late stage review mechanism.

## Step 2: Avoid having to apply for grant funding
The Mayor's planning policy requires all schemes to investigate the availability of public subsidy in order to maximise affordable housing provision (para 2.5) of the [Affordable Housing SPG](https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/planning/implementing-london-plan/planning-guidance-and-practice-notes/affordable-housing-and-viability-supplementary-planning-guidance-spg)

But by accompanying a planning application with a viability assessment saying that 35% affordable is being offered despite 0% being the maximum viable amount, the developer is able to avoid the grant funding available under paragraph 52 of the [Mayor's funding guidance](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/homesforlondoners-affordablehomesprogrammefundingguidance.pdf) and invoke paragraph 80 which requires at least 40% affordable housing provision to be eligible for any grant funding.

This then enables the developer argue that the conversion of 5% of its private homes to affordable housing (difference between 35% and 40%) would render the scheme less viable because of the 'gap' between the high value private sales and low value affordale units (- lead in to the case of Southernwood retail park.)

This clearly invokes [Paragraph A(4) of Policy of H5 of the London Plan](https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/planning/london-plan/new-london-plan/draft-new-london-plan/chapter-4-housing/policy-h5-delivering-affordable-housing) which requires 'public sector land delivering at least 50 per cent affordable housing'.

The planning committee report fudges the question of the higher threshold for public sector land:

![](http://35percent.org/img/southernwoodor.png)

It refers the question to the GLA's Guidance Note - [Threshold Approach to Affordable Housing on Public Land](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/practice_note_on_threshold_approach_to_affordable_housing_on_public_land_july_2018.pdf) which defines 'public land' as _"Land that is owned or in use by a public sector organisation, or company or organisation in public ownership." (para 9) and goes on to say that any question of what constitutes public land _"will be determined with reference to the [Public Sector Classifications Guide (PSCG) published by the Office for National Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/uksectoraccounts/datasets/publicsectorclassificationguide)"_ which says that:  

> "ONS concluded that a Local Government Pension Scheme was the pension administrator in the public pension fund subsector (S.12901) and (ii) Local Authorities in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland were the scheme’s pension manager in the local government subsector (S.1313). This means any difference between the pension entitlements and the assets held by the Scheme will be attributed to the local government subsector as an asset/liability."

Additional cost
GE’s appraisal incorporates £4.7 million of additional costs which are identified as confidential for
commercial reasons.

£785 per square foot sales estimate - current day values and as BNP Paribas points out based on sales on ex-local authority flats on surrounding estates. No consideration that it will be next to a zone 1 Bakerloo line tube station. Scheme will pay just £2m in Mayoral CIL, presumably towards cost of tube station.
