## Third of big four Old Kent Rd developments goes to committee 

The proposal for the development of Southernwood Retail Park is due to be decided at Southwark's planning committee this Tuesday. Developer [Glasgow City Council wants permission](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!KrRBUGorCJrSgSs6BtYYVw%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) for a mixed-use development of 725 residential units, with a hotel, cinema, shops, restaurants and offices.

The site is currently occupied by Argos and Sports Direct, just opposite Tesco and over the road from Burgess Park.  The [proposed scheme](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=externalDocuments&keyVal=_STHWR_DCAPR_9580625) has seven blocks, including a 48 storey tower.

The scheme offers 35% affordable housing; 25% of the total housing will be social rent, 10% intermediate )(rounded up figures), in line with the [emerging New Southwark Plan](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning-policy-and-transport-policy/development-plan/local-plan?chapter=4).
It joins Ruby Triangle, Cantium Retail Park and Malt St as [one of four major developments](https://www.homesandproperty.co.uk/property-news/old-kent-road-set-for-major-highrise-transformation-with-20000-new-homes-if-bakerloo-line-extension-a125611.html),delivering xxxx homes in total, that have or will be determined in advance of the adoption of the [Old Kent Rd Area Action Plan]  (https://www.southwark.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning-policy-and-transport-policy/development-plan/area-action-plans?chapter=2). Numerous smaller developments are also [in the pipeline](link).

## Affordable housing - 35%, 40% or 50%?

Two features in Southernwood application stand out, though - the first is that the applicant, Glasgow City Council, is a local authority and second, its reluctance to take advantage of public funding from the Mayor of London that could raise the affordable housing to 40% get us another 30 or so afforable homes.

This is worth examining, leads us, as always, to viability

The developer should be obliged to apply for publci funding aand a decision deferreed until that is secured

(loss of light industrial space; SLC objection)

follows the Ruby Triangle and Cantium Retail Park as the latest the big developments along the Old Kent Rd to , . to go to planning, in advance of the Old Kent Rd Area Action Plan, which now begins to look increasingly redundant being adopted

The site is just opposite Tesco, proposed site of a future Bakerloo line extension, and over the Road from Burgess Park and so is well placed




Viability assessments have become notorious as a means used by developers to [avoid meeting](https://england.shelter.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/1434439/2017.11.01_Slipping_through_the_loophole.pdf) their affordable housing obligations. The assessments purport to show that the requirements laid down by local authorities cannot be met without rendering the scheme financially unviable and thus undeliverable, leading to the affordable housing requirement being reduced  

Over the past few years housing [campaigners](/viability-assessments)and several [high profile](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jun/25/london-developers-viability-planning-affordable-social-housing-regeneration-oliver-wainwright) cases have managed to shed some light on this dark art how, leading to [changes in policy](https://www.insidehousing.co.uk/home/home/london-borough-makes-viability-assessments-public-54133) and greater scrutiny of developer's viability claims.

In Southwark this had meant we are starting [to get 35% affordable housing](examples) that we have been denied until now.  But while developers are offering 35% affordable housing, they continue to insist that their scemes are unviable.  Southernwood Retail Park is a case in point.  Here the developer (Glasgow City Council) claims that they will only make 2.24% profit on Gross Development Value (GDV); Southwark's consultants beg to differ and say 16.37% can be made.  Both figures fall short of the developer's profit target (set by themselves) of 18.84%, so the development is officially 'unviable',  Nonetheless the developer says that they will deliver 35% affordable housing, 25% social rent, 10% intermediate, in line with local housing policy.

The reason developers are pleading poverty despite offering 35% affordable housing is that they know values will rise with the arrival of the Bakerloo line and that they may be subjected to an 'early stage viability review' if the scheme is not implemented within two years.

This is a requirement of the [Mayor's planning policy](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/ah_viability_spg_201708152.pdf) which also imposes a 'late stage viability review' for schemes that don't meet the 35% affordable housing requirement. This is a more comprehensive review which forces developers to disclose in detail the actual costs spent, revenue received and actual profit made from a scheme in order for a local authority to be able to 'claw back' additional affordable housing from the surplus profit.

Hence the recent flurry of schemes offering the 35% in order to avoid a late stage review at the same time as pleading viability poverty such that the viability baseline used in the event of an early stage review is kept very low.

The [Mayor's policy](https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/planning/london-plan/new-london-plan/draft-new-london-plan/chapter-4-housing/policy-h6-threshold-approach-applications) has two exceptions where in the case of public land or sites in Strategic Industrial Locations the threshold is increased to 50%.

![](http://35percent.org/img/lph6.png)

The Southernwood Retail Park falls into both of these categories. It is [listed](https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/planning/london-plan/new-london-plan/draft-new-london-plan/chapter-6-economy/policy-e5-strategic-industrial-locations-sil) in the Mayor's policy as a Strategic Industrial Location and [Land Registry deeds](35percent.org/lrdeeds/SouthernwoodRetailPark.pdf) show Glasgow City Council as the owner on behalf of its pension fund.

![](http://35percent.org/img/SouthernwoodRetailParkdeeds.png)

The Mayor's planning policy is supplemented by a Guidance Note for determining what constitutes public land - [Threshold Approach to Affordable Housing on Public Land (July 2018)](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/practice_note_on_threshold_approach_to_affordable_housing_on_public_land_july_2018.pdf) defining it as _"Land that is owned or in use by a public sector organisation, or company or organisation in public ownership" (para 9) and going on to say that any disputes concerning the definition of public land _"will be determined with reference to the [Public Sector Classifications Guide (PSCG) published by the Office for National Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/uksectoraccounts/datasets/publicsectorclassificationguide)"_.

The Classifications Guide specifically includes land owned by Local Government pension schemes:  

> "ONS concluded that a Local Government Pension Scheme was the pension administrator in the public pension fund subsector (S.12901) and (ii) Local Authorities in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland were the scheme’s pension manager in the local government subsector (S.1313). This means any difference between the pension entitlements and the assets held by the Scheme will be attributed to the local government subsector as an asset/liability."

Notwithstanding this Southwark argues in its planning committee report that imposing the higher 50% affordable housing threshold _"would reduce the capital value of the site and therefore the Fund’s ability to pay pensions to retired workers"_ and that _"It would be unfair on the retired workers if their pension expectation might possibly be impacted.."_

[Objections](https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/historic-england-raises-concern-over-pilbrow-and-partners-southwark-tower/10038794.article) have been made by Historic England.

Southwark's [independent review](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!wHlqJHGSqYenUM8dzFIwTw%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) of the applicant's viability assessment raises the issue of a £4.7m unitemised cost - unexplained because of 'commercial confidentiality'. 

![](http://35percent.org/img/addcosts.png)

There's little point in forcing developers to disclose viability assessments if major components of these can't be interrogated because of 'commercial confidentiality'.
