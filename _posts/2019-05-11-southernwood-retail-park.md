title: Southernwood Retail Park next big OKRd planning decision
---

## Third of big four Old Kent Rd developments goes to committee 

[A proposal](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=externalDocuments&keyVal=_STHWR_DCAPR_9580625) for the development of Southernwood Retail Park is due to be decided at Southwark's planning committee this Tuesday. Developer [Glasgow City Council, acting as trustees for Strathclyde Pension Fund, wants permission](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!KrRBUGorCJrSgSs6BtYYVw%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) for a mixed-use development of 725 residential units, with a hotel, cinema, shops, restaurants and offices.  The proposed scheme has seven blocks, including a 48 storey tower.  The site is currently occupied by Argos and Sports Direct, just opposite Tesco and over the road from Burgess Park. 

Southernwood offers, in round figures, 35% affordable housing; 25% of the total housing will be social rent, 10% intermediate, in line with the [emerging New Southwark Plan](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning-policy-and-transport-policy/development-plan/local-plan?chapter=4), giving 219 units.

## Viability conundrum

Viability assessments have become notorious as a way for developers to [avoid](https://england.shelter.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/1434439/2017.11.01_Slipping_through_the_loophole.pdf) their affordable housing obligations.  Over the past few years housing [campaigners](/viability-assessments) and several [high profile](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jun/25/london-developers-viability-planning-affordable-social-housing-regeneration-oliver-wainwright) cases have managed to shed some light on this practice, leading to [changes in policy](https://www.insidehousing.co.uk/home/home/london-borough-makes-viability-assessments-public-54133) and greater scrutiny of developer's viability claims.

In Southwark this had meant we are starting [to get 35% affordable housing](examples) that we have been denied until now.  But while developers are offering 35% affordable housing, they continue to insist that their scemes are unviable.  Southernwood Retail Park is a case in point.  Here the developer (Glasgow City Council) claims that they will only make 2.24% (£8.4m) profit on Gross Development Value (GDV); Southwark's consultants beg to differ and say 16.37% (£62.5m) can be made.  Both figures fall short of Glasgow CC's profit target (set by themselves) of 18.84%, so the development is technically 'unviable'. 

Glasgow CC's 18.84% target exceeds the benchmark return of 10.4% set by the Glasgow pension fund for DTZ, who manage Southernwood on their behalf (See DTZ, pg 97 in Strathcyde Pension Fund's [most recent annual report](http://www.spfo.org.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=42886&p=0)).

Despite Southernwood being 'unviable', Galsgow CC says that it will deliver 35% affordable housing, 25% social rent, 10% intermediate, in line with local housing policy. The Officer's report accepts the 35% affordable offer, but without addressing the difference in the profit estimates or considering the difference in the profit target and the pension fund's DTZ benchmark.

After so many major developments [at the Elephant & Castle](http://35percent.org/ivorytowers.html) and elsewhere in Southwark have been allowed to flout affordable housing requirements, this can be counted as progress, but leaves the true viability of the Southernwood scheme unresolved.  This is important, because as well as all the quantitative affordable housing requirements, there is also a [general requirement to produce the maximum reasonable amount of affordable housing](https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/planning/london-plan/current-london-plan/london-plan-chapter-3/policy-312-negotiating), which obviously cannot be known, unless the real viability psition is known.

Southern joins [Ruby Triangle](http://35percent.org/2018-10-08-ruby-triangle-goes-to-committee/) and [Cantium Retail Park](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!4ZdM8nfyvjj19tOftU%2fPPQ%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) as an 'unviable' scheme that will deliver 35% affordable housing.  Unlike Ruby Triangle, but like Cantium Retail Park, no 'late stage review' of viability is proposed for Southernwood. This is a comprehensive review where developers should disclose in detail actual costs and revenue received, to establish the schemes's real profitability and enable the local authority to 'claw back' additional affordable housing, should the profit be greater than anticipated.  Given the site's position alongside the likely site of a new tube station should the Bakerloo line extension be built, this looks like a serious ommission.

## Public funding? No thank you.

 Glasgow CC also claim that the development as it is will only make a profit of [2.4% GDV (Gross Development Value)](link cash figure) and that raising the level of affordable housing, with grant, would reduce this by £4.45m, even if they obtained a grant.


Achieving 40% affordable housing has the advantage that all the affordable homes become eligible for the grant


## Affordable housing - 35%, 40% or 50%?

Two other features in Southernwood application stand out - the first is that the applicant, Glasgow City Council, is reluctant to take advantage of any public funding, such as that [available from the Mayor of London](https://www.london.gov.uk/file/11941201), which could raise the affordable housing to at least 40%, giving another 30 or so affordable homes.  All schemes are expected to consider this, to maximise affordable housing, under the [Mayor's Housing policy](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/ah_viability_spg_20170816.pdf).  Glasgow CC's surprising explanation for not applying for public funding is that it claims it will make the scheme less viable.  As related in the [planning commitee report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!Z%2fngWgPScvw3gDPzmFkc8A%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d)(Para 182,183), this is because the £28,000 per unit grant will not make up the full loss in value of converting free market units into affordable units.  Glasgow CC also say that they will not be in time for the current funding round; the Officer's report proposes a condition that this is reconsidered, before the scheme is implemented, in the event of permission being given.

The second feature is that the site is both owned by a local authority and is in an area marked as a Strategic Industrial Location and on both counts should deliver 50% affordable housing, under the [draft New London Plan](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/draft_london_plan_-showing_minor_suggested_changes_july_2018.pdf), raising the number to about 360.

Glasgow CC submitted its own legal opinion on this, arguing that the site should not be considered as public land because it would [harm pensioners' benefits]((Para 173 of [planning committee report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!Z%2fngWgPScvw3gDPzmFkc8A%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d)) from the scheme and Southwark and the Greater London Authority (GLA) have accepted that only 35% affordable housing is required. 

There can be no argument that the land is owned by Glasgow City Council, on behalf of its pension fund, as [land Registry deeds](35percent.org/lrdeeds/SouthernwoodRetailPark.pdf) show.

![](http://35percent.org/img/SouthernwoodRetailParkdeeds.png)

The Mayor's planning policy also has its own a Guidance Note for determining what constitutes public land - [Threshold Approach to Affordable Housing on Public Land (July 2018)](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/practice_note_on_threshold_approach_to_affordable_housing_on_public_land_july_2018.pdf).  This defines it as _"Land that is owned or in use by a public sector organisation, or company or organisation in public ownership"_ (para 9).  Anticipating disputes on the definition, the note goes on to say that these _"will be determined with reference to the [Public Sector Classifications Guide (PSCG) published by the Office for National Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/uksectoraccounts/datasets/publicsectorclassificationguide)"_
and this guide lists Local Government Pension Funds as a [public sector body](https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/classificationsandstandards/economicstatisticsclassifications/introductiontoeconomicstatisticsclassifications).  

Notwithstanding this Southwark argues in the legal advice appended to the [planning committee report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!Z%2fngWgPScvw3gDPzmFkc8A%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) that imposing the higher 50% affordable housing  _"would reduce the capital value of the site and therefore the Fund’s ability to pay pensions to retired workers"_ and that _"It would be unfair on the retired workers if their pension expectation might possibly be impacted.."_

It might well be 'unfair' to pensioners if this happened, but it would also be 'unfair' to those who need affordable housing, if it is not delivered, when it is due by a policy and this counterargument has not been made.

As unedifying as it would be to see two local authorities fight over their respective shares of a developer's profit, one on behalf of pensioners, the other, on behalf of those who need affordable housing, Southwark and GLA's responsibility in this situation is to vigorously represent the interests of those in housing need and it has not done so, by giving way so easily.



## Public land? Maybe not

Glasgow CC, as trustees of Strathclyde Pension Fund, submitted its own legal opinion on this, arguing that the site should not be considered as public land because it would harm pensioners' beneifits from the scheme. Southwark and [GLA](link) have fallen into line behind this.


The planning commitee will be very tempted to pass this appication, given it gets 35% a/h, but it should not it should defer it until GLA gives its verdict on the public land question and the developer in any event should be obliged to apply for publci funding and a decision deferreed until that is secured.

(loss of light industrial space; SLC objection)

follows the Ruby Triangle and Cantium Retail Park as the latest the big developments along the Old Kent Rd to , . to go to planning, in advance of the Old Kent Rd Area Action Plan, which now begins to look increasingly redundant being adopted

## TfL gives scheme the red light

There also appears to be a major issues around the impact of the developent on plans for the proposed Bakerloo Line Extension (BLE). In [their latest communication](link) posted on the planning website, dated 1 May 2019 TfL urge Southwark not to approve the application, other than the back of teh development.

TfL make the damning accusation that Southwark has _'no joined-up thinking'_, which must sting after several years of consultation and planning for the yet-to-be adopted [Old Kent Rd Area Action Plan (AAP) and Opportunity Area](link).  It also adds weight to the argument that the whole Oppourtunity Area project is developer-driven, rather than plan-led and that the approval of major developments, such as Southernwood in advance of the adoption of the AAP is rendering it redundant.

The TfL objection is also serious in respect of the general viability of opportunity area developments.  As noted above, Ruby Triangle, Cantium Retail Park were both declared technically non-viable and depend upon the rise in land values that the Bakerloo Extension will bring, so should there be problems with this, it could have ramifications for their promises of  affordable housing.

## Density

![](http://35percent.org/img/southernwoodretailpark.jpg)

The reason developers are pleading poverty despite offering 35% affordable housing is that they know values will rise with the arrival of the Bakerloo line and that they may be subjected to an 'early stage viability review' if the scheme is not implemented within two years.

![](http://35percent.org/img/lph6.png)

The Southernwood Retail Park falls into both of these categories. It is [listed](https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/planning/london-plan/new-london-plan/draft-new-london-plan/chapter-6-economy/policy-e5-strategic-industrial-locations-sil) in the Mayor's policy as a Strategic Industrial Location 

Former deputy Council leader turned development consultant has assisted by ['providing public affairs and stakeholder engagement services and arranging meetings with key stakeholders'](http://carvil-ventures.co.uk/southernwood-retail-park-old-kent-road). 

[Objections](https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/historic-england-raises-concern-over-pilbrow-and-partners-southwark-tower/10038794.article) have been made by Historic England.

Despite both Southwark and Glasgow City Council being signed up to and active members of the Living Wage Campaign, neither have decided to use their respective influence to ensure that any employees associated with the construction of this scheme or the ongoing running of the cinema are paid the London Living Wage.

*Paragraph 141 of the [planning committee report](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s82616/Report%20Southernwood%20Retail%20Park%202%20Humphrey%20Street%20London%20SE1%205JJ.pdf)*

Southwark's [independent review](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!wHlqJHGSqYenUM8dzFIwTw%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) of the applicant's viability assessment raises the issue of a £4.7m unitemised cost - unexplained because of 'commercial confidentiality'. 

![](http://35percent.org/img/addcosts.png)

There's little point in forcing developers to disclose viability assessments if major components of these can't be interrogated because of 'commercial confidentiality'.

Glasgow's pension fund's [viability assessment](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!usFYGB9yhRh95Q0p6tmP8g%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) also claims that it will incur a £44m financing cost, representing 7% interest on loans that it will have to take out to fund the scheme. This is not supported by any evidence - there is no explanation why a pension fund with over £20 billion in funds would need to borrow money. 

Hence the recent flurry of schemes offering the 35%  at the same time as pleading viability poverty such that the viability baseline used in the event of an early stage review is kept very low.

It joins Ruby Triangle, Cantium Retail Park and Malt St as [one of four major developments](https://www.homesandproperty.co.uk/property-news/old-kent-road-set-for-major-highrise-transformation-with-20000-new-homes-if-bakerloo-line-extension-a125611.html),delivering xxxx homes in total, that have or will be determined in advance of the adoption of the [Old Kent Rd Area Action Plan]  (https://www.southwark.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning-policy-and-transport-policy/development-plan/area-action-plans?chapter=2). Numerous smaller developments are also [in the pipeline](link).

The [Mayor's policy](https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/planning/london-plan/new-london-plan/draft-new-london-plan/chapter-4-housing/policy-h6-threshold-approach-applications) has two exceptions where in the case of public land or sites in Strategic Industrial Locations the threshold is increased to 50%.
