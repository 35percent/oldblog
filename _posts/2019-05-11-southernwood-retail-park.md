## Third of big four Old Kent Rd developments goes to committee 

[A proposal](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=externalDocuments&keyVal=_STHWR_DCAPR_9580625) for the development of Southernwood Retail Park is due to be decided at Southwark's planning committee this Tuesday. Developer [Glasgow City Council, acting as trustees for Strathclyde Pension Fund, wants permission](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!KrRBUGorCJrSgSs6BtYYVw%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) for a mixed-use development of 725 residential units, with a hotel, cinema, shops, restaurants and offices.  The proposed scheme has seven blocks, including a 48 storey tower.  The site is currently occupied by Argos and Sports Direct, just opposite Tesco and over the road from Burgess Park. 

Southernwood offers, in round figures, 35% affordable housing; 25% of the total housing will be social rent, 10% intermediate, in line with the [emerging New Southwark Plan](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning-policy-and-transport-policy/development-plan/local-plan?chapter=4), giving 219 units.

## Viability conundrum

Viability assessments have become notorious as a means used by developers to [avoid meeting](https://england.shelter.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/1434439/2017.11.01_Slipping_through_the_loophole.pdf) their affordable housing obligations. The assessments purport to show that the requirements laid down by local authorities cannot be met without rendering the scheme financially unviable and thus undeliverable, leading to the affordable housing requirement being reduced  

Over the past few years housing [campaigners](/viability-assessments)and several [high profile](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jun/25/london-developers-viability-planning-affordable-social-housing-regeneration-oliver-wainwright) cases have managed to shed some light on this dark art how, leading to [changes in policy](https://www.insidehousing.co.uk/home/home/london-borough-makes-viability-assessments-public-54133) and greater scrutiny of developer's viability claims.

In Southwark this had meant we are starting [to get 35% affordable housing](examples) that we have been denied until now.  But while developers are offering 35% affordable housing, they continue to insist that their scemes are unviable.  Southernwood Retail Park is a case in point.  Here the developer (Glasgow City Council) claims that they will only make 2.24% profit on Gross Development Value (GDV); Southwark's consultants beg to differ and say 16.37% can be made.  Both figures fall short of the developer's profit target (set by themselves) of 18.84%, so the development is officially 'unviable',  Nonetheless the developer says that they will deliver 35% affordable housing, 25% social rent, 10% intermediate, in line with local housing policy.  

Southernwood joins [Ruby Triangle](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!oY11bGc7aC6RJOzPXGXlpQ%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) and [Cantium Retail Park](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!4ZdM8nfyvjj19tOftU%2fPPQ%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) as a scheme where the developer offers 35% affordable housing, while at the same time insisting it is unviable. Southwark's consultants agree, but estimate that Southernwood can generate a much higher level of profit than developer Glasgow CC claim.  The Officer's report accepts the 35% affordable offer, but without addressing the two different profit estimates.

After so many major developments [at the Elephant & Castle](link) and elsewhere in Southwark have been allowed to flout affordable housing requirements on viability grounds, this can be counted as progress, but leaves the true viability of the Southernwood scheme unresolved.  This is important, because as well as all the quantitative affordable housing requirements, there is also a general requirement to produce [the maximum reasonable amount of affordable housing](link).

Unlike Ruby Triangle, but like Cantium Retail Park, no 'late stage review' of viability is proposed for Southernwood. This is a more comprehensive review where developers should disclose in detail actual costs, revenue received and profit made from a scheme and establish the schemes's real profitability, in order for the local authority to 'claw back' additional affordable housing from any greater profit.  Given the site's position alongside the likely site of a new tube station should the Bakerloo line extension be built, this looks like a serious ommission.

## Affordable housing - 35%, 40% or 50%?

Two other features in Southernwood application stand out - the first is that the applicant, Glasgow City Council, is reluctant to take advantage of any public funding, [available from the Mayor of London](link), which could raise the affordable housing to at least 40%, giving another 30 or so affordable homes.  All schemes are expected to consider this, to maximise affordable housing, under the [Mayor's Housing policy](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/ah_viability_spg_20170816.pdf).  The Officer's report proposes a condition that this is reconsidered, before the scheme is implemented, if permission is given.

The second feature is that the site is both owned by a local authority and is area marked as a Strategic Industrial Location and on both counts should deliver 50% affordable housing(link), under the [draft New London Plan](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/draft_london_plan_-showing_minor_suggested_changes_july_2018.pdf), raising the number to about 360.

Glasgow CC, as trustees of Strathclyde Pension Fund, submitted its own legal opinion on this, arguing that the site should not be considered as public land because it would harm pensioners' beneifits from the scheme. Southwark and [GLA](link) have fallen into line behind this.

[Land Registry deeds](35percent.org/lrdeeds/SouthernwoodRetailPark.pdf) show Glasgow City Council as the owner on behalf of its pension fund.

![](http://35percent.org/img/SouthernwoodRetailParkdeeds.png)

The Mayor's planning policy is supplemented by a Guidance Note for determining what constitutes public land - [Threshold Approach to Affordable Housing on Public Land (July 2018)](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/practice_note_on_threshold_approach_to_affordable_housing_on_public_land_july_2018.pdf) defining it as _"Land that is owned or in use by a public sector organisation, or company or organisation in public ownership" (para 9) and going on to say that any disputes concerning the definition of public land _"will be determined with reference to the [Public Sector Classifications Guide (PSCG) published by the Office for National Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/uksectoraccounts/datasets/publicsectorclassificationguide)"_

The Classifications Guide says that 'assets', which we think must include land, held by by Local Government pension schemes are attributable to local government:  

> "ONS concluded that a Local Government Pension Scheme was the pension administrator in the public pension fund subsector (S.12901) and (ii) Local Authorities in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland were the scheme’s pension manager in the local government subsector (S.1313). This means any difference between the pension entitlements and the assets held by the Scheme will be attributed to the local government subsector as an asset/liability."

Notwithstanding this Southwark argues in its planning committee report that imposing the higher 50% affordable housing  _"would reduce the capital value of the site and therefore the Fund’s ability to pay pensions to retired workers"_ and that _"It would be unfair on the retired workers if their pension expectation might possibly be impacted.."_

As unedifying as it would be to see two local authorities to fight over who should benefit over their share of the profit of a private development, one on behalf of pensioners, the other on behalf of those in need of affordable housing, Southwark (and GLA) hae given way too easily on this argument.  It also points to a fundamental flaw in the whole developer market-led model - we should not have to trade-off pensions against affordable housing.





## Public funding? No thank you.

The surprising reason Glasgow City Council (Glasgow CC) give for not applying for public funding is that it claims it will make the scheme [less viable](link).  As related in the [Officer's report](link para), this is because the £28,000 per unit grant will not make up the full loss in value of converting free market units into affordable units.  Glasgow CC also claim that the development as it is will only make a profit of [2.4% GDV (Gross Development Value)](link cash figure) and that raising the level of affordable housing, with grant, would reduce this by £4.45m, even if they obtained a grant.

GCC is roundly contradicted by Southwark's own consultants though who say that a profit of 16.37% GDV can be achieved, though this is still below the target profit Glasgow CC of 18.84% set for itself.  

Achieving 40% affordable housing has the advantage that all the affordable homes become eligible for the grant


## Public land? Maybe not

Glasgow CC, as trustees of Strathclyde Pension Fund, submitted its own legal opinion on this, arguing that the site should not be considered as public land because it would harm pensioners' beneifits from the scheme. Southwark and [GLA](link) have fallen into line behind this.


The planning commitee will be very tempted to pass this appication, given it gets 35% a/h, but it should not it should defer it until GLA gives its verdict on the public land question and the developer in any event should be obliged to apply for publci funding and a decision deferreed until that is secured.

(loss of light industrial space; SLC objection)

follows the Ruby Triangle and Cantium Retail Park as the latest the big developments along the Old Kent Rd to , . to go to planning, in advance of the Old Kent Rd Area Action Plan, which now begins to look increasingly redundant being adopted

## TfL gives scheme the red light

There also appears to be a major issues around the impact of the developent on plans for the proposed Bakerloo Line Extension (BLE). In [their latest communication](link) posted on the planning website, dated 1 May 2019 TfL urge Southwark not to approve the application, other than the back of teh development.

TfL make the damning accusation that Southwark has 'no joined-up thinking', which must sting after several years of consultation and planning for the yet-to-be adopted [Old Kent Rd Area Action Plan (AAP) and Opportunity Area](link).  It also adds weight to the argument that the whole Oppourtunity Area project is developer-driven, rather than plan-led and that the approval of major developments, such as Southernwood in advance of the adoption of the AAP is rendering it redundant.

The TfL objection is also serious in respect of the general viability of opportunity area developments.  As noted above, Ruby Triangle, Cantium Retail Park were both declared technically non-viable and depend upon the rise in land values that the Bakerloo Extension will bring, so should there be problems with this, it could have ramifications for their promises of  affordable housing.

## Density

![](http://35percent.org/img/southernwoodretailpark.jpg)

The reason developers are pleading poverty despite offering 35% affordable housing is that they know values will rise with the arrival of the Bakerloo line and that they may be subjected to an 'early stage viability review' if the scheme is not implemented within two years.


![](http://35percent.org/img/lph6.png)

The Southernwood Retail Park falls into both of these categories. It is [listed](https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/planning/london-plan/new-london-plan/draft-new-london-plan/chapter-6-economy/policy-e5-strategic-industrial-locations-sil) in the Mayor's policy as a Strategic Industrial Location 

Former deputy Council leader turned development consultant has assisted by ['providing public affairs and stakeholder engagement services and arranging meetings with key stakeholders'](http://carvil-ventures.co.uk/southernwood-retail-park-old-kent-road). 

[Objections](https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/historic-england-raises-concern-over-pilbrow-and-partners-southwark-tower/10038794.article) have been made by Historic England.

Southwark's [independent review](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!wHlqJHGSqYenUM8dzFIwTw%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) of the applicant's viability assessment raises the issue of a £4.7m unitemised cost - unexplained because of 'commercial confidentiality'. 

![](http://35percent.org/img/addcosts.png)

There's little point in forcing developers to disclose viability assessments if major components of these can't be interrogated because of 'commercial confidentiality'.

Hence the recent flurry of schemes offering the 35%  at the same time as pleading viability poverty such that the viability baseline used in the event of an early stage review is kept very low.

It joins Ruby Triangle, Cantium Retail Park and Malt St as [one of four major developments](https://www.homesandproperty.co.uk/property-news/old-kent-road-set-for-major-highrise-transformation-with-20000-new-homes-if-bakerloo-line-extension-a125611.html),delivering xxxx homes in total, that have or will be determined in advance of the adoption of the [Old Kent Rd Area Action Plan]  (https://www.southwark.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning-policy-and-transport-policy/development-plan/area-action-plans?chapter=2). Numerous smaller developments are also [in the pipeline](link).

The [Mayor's policy](https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/planning/london-plan/new-london-plan/draft-new-london-plan/chapter-4-housing/policy-h6-threshold-approach-applications) has two exceptions where in the case of public land or sites in Strategic Industrial Locations the threshold is increased to 50%.
