In 2015 there was [uproar](https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/your-home-is-worth-less-than-nothing-council-report-evaluates-southwark-properties/) after Southwark carried out a [survey](http://35percent.org/the-southwark-clearances/#completing-southwarks-clearances-with-savills) of its council estates, identifying those with a 'net negative value'. 

In response to media criticism, the Council's Cabinet member for Housing promised that there would be _'no more wholesale estate demolition'_.

*Cllr Livingstone's promise to council estate residents in the [Southwark News](https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/no-more-wholesale-estate-demolition-says-housing-boss/)*

Cllr Livingstone [promises](https://twitter.com/Livingstone_RJ/status/846835559230267392) that there will no net loss of 'council homes' on the Tustin. But we point out that Cllr Livingstone was one of the Cabinet members that [voted on signing of the Heygate deal](http://moderngov.southwarksites.com/documents/s10891/Elephant%20and%20Castle%20-%20Regeneration%20Agreement%20and%20Disposal%20of%20Associated%20Land%20-%20Report.pdf) with Lendlease, which had originally made similar promises.

## Tustin estate
However, a recently published council [briefing report](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s67406/Report.pdf) has revealed plans to demolish circa 200 homes on the Old Kent Road's Tustin estate.

We [reported last year](http://35percent.org/2016-07-10-opportunity-knocks-down-the-old-kent-road/) how the Council's designation of the Old Kent Road as an 'Opportunity Area' would inevitably lead to ....

## New 'council homes' - privatisation via the back door
The build programme is being used both as an excuse to demolish the borough's council estates; and as an excuse to privatise public land, as the land used to build the new homes is council land. Often green space, but also schools, play areas a library etc.

The new 'council' homes will only be 25% social rented.  SRPP report.

## 11000 new council homes
During the interview, Cllr John brushes off criticism concerning the loss of social housing on the Heygate, with the claim that Southwark has got the country's largest council house building programme, with a target of building 11,000 new council homes over the next 30 years (366 per year).  
However, [data just published by the 
government](https://medium.com/@lukewbarratt/fact-checking-hackney-mayor-philip-glanville-on-social-housing-b3ceeeaf53e3#.149mqus0q) shows that during the last 12 months Southwark built just 74 new council homes. At this rate it will be 149 years before it reaches its target of 11,000 new council homes.
  
[Government 
data](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/568423/LiveTable_123.xls) shows that in the same year it demolished 410 homes.
