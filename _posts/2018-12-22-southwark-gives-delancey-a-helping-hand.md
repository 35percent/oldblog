## Council passes up chance of refusing Elephant Shopping Centre application

As we anticipated in our [last blogpost](http://35percent.org/2018-12-16-mayor-approves-shopping-centre/) Delancey missed the deadline for completing the legal S106 agreement that seals [the planning approval](http://35percent.org/2018-07-09-delancey/) for the shopping centre redevelopment.

Missing the deadline put the power of refusing the redevelopment application back into the Southwark Council's hands, but instead of a refusal, Southwark sent Delancey a [letter](https://twitter.com/35percent_EAN/status/1074272767074291712) saying that it had no intention of doing such a thing and that _'all of the 'substantive requirements'__ of the S106 had been met.  

This ignores the requirement to secure planning approval for the temporary relocation facility for traders at Castle Square, deferred by the [planning sub-committee](http://35percent.org/2018-12-16-mayor-approves-shopping-centre/) on 12 December, until 7 January.  Southwark generously tells Delancey that this was _'now not in your control'_, which implies a failure on the part of the planning sub-committee, rather than Delancey's failure to submit an application that the committee could be confident met traders' needs. 

The Castle Square application was deferred to allow officers time to ['corroborate rent levels](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!12dhIwvd2JFDUQgBXBnMXA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) paid by some of the existing shopping centre traders' and check whether they would be paying more or less, if they moved to Castle Sq.  Nonetheless, Southwark reassures Delancey that there will be an ‘officer recommendation for approval’ of application, which raises a question of how much weight any new data will be given in deciding the application.

In a revealing phrase 


Meantime members of planning sub-committee B may be wondering who the decision makers are in the Council, when Southwark's letter clearly intimates that the all-important Castle Sq application for a temporary relocation facility for traders would eventually be approved. They may or not be reassured that A further letter from Southwark says that the  Delancey cannot proceed with the shopping centre development 

The letter also itimated tha the all-important
