title: Southwark gives Delancey a helping hand

## Council passes up chance of refusing Elephant Shopping Centre application

As we anticipated in our [last blogpost](http://35percent.org/2018-12-16-mayor-approves-shopping-centre/) Delancey missed the deadline for completing the legal S106 agreement that seals [the planning approval](http://35percent.org/2018-07-09-delancey/) for the shopping centre redevelopment.

Missing the deadline put the power of refusing the redevelopment application back into the Southwark Council's handshands, but instead of a refusal Southwark sent Delancey a [letter with the reassurance](https://twitter.com/35percent_EAN/status/1074272767074291712) that it had no intention of doing such a thing.
