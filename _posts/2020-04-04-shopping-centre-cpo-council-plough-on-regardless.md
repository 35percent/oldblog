title: Shopping centre CPO - Southwark ploughs on regardless
---
## Southwark assumes CPO powers, but gets nothing in return

Southwark Council is [set to assume Compulsory Purchase Order](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/mgIssueHistoryHome.aspx?IId=50015357) (CPO) powers, on behalf of shopping centre developer Delancey, at its Cabinet meeting this [Tues 7 April](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=302&MId=6420&Ver=4) (postponed from 24 March).  While this extraordinary move will strengthen Delancey's hand in ongoing negotiations with various development stakeholders, such as TfL, and will relieve Delancey of funding risks, the scheme itself remains unchanged, delivering only 116 social rented units and displacing traders wholesale.

The Cabinet meeting is also set to approve [a report that will override](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/mgIssueHistoryHome.aspx?IId=50021995) local residents' legal rights, for the  loss of light caused by the redevelopment.  A [third report](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s88157/Report%20EC%20Shopping%20Centre%20Progress.pdf) will approve the recently announced £200,000 relocation assistance for traders.

The meeting will be by videoconference, but no livestream is advertised.

## Residents lose legal right

As we reported in [our last blogpost](http://35percent.org/2020-03-23-shopping-centre-compulsory-purchase-order/) Southwark intends [to lease](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s88163/Report%20EC%20CPO.pdf) both the shopping centre and London College of Communications buildings themselves.  Subleasing arrangements will return the shopping centre and LCC back to the control of Delancey and University of the Arts London, but as nominal public property, residents legal 'right-to-light' options can be overridden.  Residents will [no longer be able to seek](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s88172/Report%20EC%20Property%20Rights.pdf) an injunction against the development (while remaining able to claim compensation).  Southwark say that there will be no cost to the Council from their leasing arrangements, other than officer time, but the report supplies no figures. 

## No guarantee scheme will be built

Southwark's extraordinary measures illustrate its determined support for Delancey's redevelopment of the shopping centre, despite the [shortfall in social rented housing](http://35percent.org/shopping-centre/) provided and the mass displacement of traders.  Local charity and advocate for all traders Latin Elephant [estimates over half](http://35percent.org/2020-01-20-elephant-traders-still-homeless/) still have nowhere to go. 

Southwark's unwavering support even extends as far as [neglecting to get a guarantee](http://35percent.org/2020-03-23-shopping-centre-compulsory-purchase-order/) from Delancey that the scheme will go ahead, even should CPO powers be exercised on their behalf, saying _'it is not necessary to impose… an obligation to build the Scheme as the measures negotiated for inclusion in the indemnity agreement give the Council comfort that EC is likely to proceed with the Scheme.’_ [^1]

## 72% say keep the centre open 

The proposed measures follow a [survey conducted by the SE1](https://twitter.com/se1/status/1240692710987558913) news website that shows 72% of local people want the centre kept open, in the light of the Coronavirus public health crisis. In response Delancey [reiterated that they still intend to close](https://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/10180?utm_source=SE1+Direct&utm_campaign=0c3a7afe5a-SE1+Direct+1000&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_9d1f71fd65-0c3a7afe5a-407867973) the shopping centre on 31 July, while waiving rent and service charges (a long-standing traders' demand) and promising to making pharmacy and food supplies available, beyond then, if the public health crisis continues.

## What we say...

The [Up the Elephant Campaign](https://twitter.com/UpTheElephant_?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor), supported by the 35% Campaign, has [consistently opposed](http://35percent.org/2017-09-23-elephant-castle-shopping-centre-update/) Delancey's shopping centre redevelopment scheme, since its inception, over 3 years ago.  We support the [ongoing legal challenge](https://www.crowdjustice.com/case/save-the-elephants-diverse-com-appeal/) to quash Delancey's planning permission.

Over time various concessions, dragged out of Delancey by campaigners, have made marginal improvements to the redevelopment.  Southwark's [pledged £200,000](https://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/10093) for the traders is also welcome; it is now urgently needs to be distributed as cash grants to traders.  Nonetheless, Delancey's scheme still remains a bad one. Delancey are [displacing an entire community of traders](http://35percent.org/2019-03-30-no-room-for-traders-in-the-new-elephant/), and destroying [a social hub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRC2cyhpzAM) for the many working people from all over the world who have made the Elephant their home.  The new development will have a miserly 116 social rented homes, out of nearly a thousand new units (if they ever get delivered).

So, Southwark Council should not be bending over backwards helping Delancey, in any circumstances - certainly not now, when half the traders still have nowhere to go, while Southwark has an [obligation to help secure traders accommodation](http://35percent.org/2020-03-23-shopping-centre-compulsory-purchase-order/) in the new development it never properly exercised.  We do not need to add that the traders' desperate situation has been rendered dire by the Coronavirus crisis.

The UP THE ELEPHANT CAMPAIGN HAS THEREFORE MADE THE FOLLOWING DEMANDS TO SOUTHWARK COUNCIL;
