title: Shopping centre CPO - Southwark ploughs on regardless
---
## Cabinet set to assume CPO powers this Tuesday

Southwark Council is [set to assume Compulsory Purchase Order](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/mgIssueHistoryHome.aspx?IId=50015357) (CPO) powers, on behalf of shopping centre developer Delancey, at its Cabinet meeting this [Tues 7 April](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=302&MId=6420&Ver=4) (postponed from 24 March).  The move would facilitate the redevelopment, by strengthening Delancey's hand in ongoing negotiations with various stakehlders, such as TfL and by relieving the project of funding risks.  The meeting will be held remotely, but no live-streaming is advertised.

The Cabinet meeting is also set to approve [a report that will override](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/mgIssueHistoryHome.aspx?IId=50021995) local residents' legal rights, for the  loss of light caused by the redevelopment.  A [third report](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s88157/Report%20EC%20Shopping%20Centre%20Progress.pdf) will approve the recently announced £200,000 relocation assistance for traders.

## Residents lose legal right

As we reported in [our last blogpost](http://35percent.org/2020-03-23-shopping-centre-compulsory-purchase-order/) Southwark intends [to lease](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s88163/Report%20EC%20CPO.pdf) both the shopping centre and London College of Communications themselves.  Subleasing arrangements will return the shopping centre and LCC back to the control Delancey and University of the Arts London, but as 'public property', residents legal 'right-to-light' options can be overridden.  Residents will [no longer be able to seek](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s88172/Report%20EC%20Property%20Rights.pdf) an injunction against the development (while remaining able to claim compensation).  Southwark say that there will be no cost to the Council from their leasing arrangements, other than officer time, but the report supplies no figures. 

## 72% say keep the centre open 

Southwark's extraordinary measures illustrate its determined support for Delancey's redevelopment of the shopping centre, despite the [shortfall in social rented housing](http://35percent.org/shopping-centre/) provided and the mass displacement of traders.  Local charity and advocates of behalf of all traders Latin Elephant [estimates over half](http://35percent.org/2020-01-20-elephant-traders-still-homeless/) still have nowhere to go.  

The proposed measures follow a [survey conducted by the SE1](https://twitter.com/se1/status/1240692710987558913) news website that shows 72% of local people want the centre kept open, in the light of the Coronavirus public health crisis. In response Delancey [reiterated that they still intend to close]((https://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/10180?utm_source=SE1+Direct&utm_campaign=0c3a7afe5a-SE1+Direct+1000&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_9d1f71fd65-0c3a7afe5a-407867973) the shopping centre on 31 July, while waiving rent and service charges (a long-standing traders' demand) and promising to making pharmacy and food supplies available, beyond then, if the public health crisis continues.

## What we say...

The [Up the Elephant Campaign](https://twitter.com/UpTheElephant_?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor), supported by the 35% Campaign, has [consistently opposed](http://35percent.org/2017-09-23-elephant-castle-shopping-centre-update/) Delancey's shopping centre redevelopment scheme, since its inception, over 3 years ago.  We support the [ongoing legal challange](https://www.crowdjustice.com/case/save-the-elephants-diverse-com-appeal/) to quash Delancey's planning permission.

Over time various concessions, dragged out of Delancey by campaigners, have made marginal improvements to the redevelopment.  Southwark's [pledged £200,000](https://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/10093) for the traders is also welcome, but Delancey's scheme still remains a bad one. Delancey are [displacing an entire community of traders](http://35percent.org/2019-03-30-no-room-for-traders-in-the-new-elephant/), and destroying [a social hub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRC2cyhpzAM) for the many working people from all over the world who have made the Elephant their home.  The new development will have a miserly 116 social rented homes, out of nearly a thousand new units (if they ever get delivered).

So, Southwark Council should not be bending over backwards helping Delancey, in any circumstances - certainly not now, when half the traders still have nowhere to go, while Southwark has an [obligation to help secure traders accommodation](http://35percent.org/2020-03-23-shopping-centre-compulsory-purchase-order/)in the new development it never properly execised.  We do not need to add that the traders' desparate situation has been rendered dire by the Coronavirus crisis.

The UP THE ELEPHANT CAMPAIGN HAS THEREFORE MADE THE FOLLOWING DEMANDS;

1. Release the promised £200,000 support as cash grants to traders immediately;
2. Do not support the use of Compulsory Purchase Order powers on Delancey’s behalf
to facilitate the development. It should be by agreement between the development
stakeholders, not forced by Southwark Council;
3. Do not close the Elephant Shopping Centre until all traders have been relocated;
4. Give all traders more money to support them through this difficult time, and
5. Support the local community, not Delancey.
