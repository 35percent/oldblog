title: Shopping centre CPO - Southwark ploughs on regardless
---
## Cabinet set to assume CPO powers this Tuesday

Southwark Council is [set to assume Compulsory Purchase Order](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/mgIssueHistoryHome.aspx?IId=50015357) (CPO) powers, on behalf of shopping centre developer Delancey at its reconvened Cabinet meeting, this [Tues 7 April](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=302&MId=6420&Ver=4).  The move would facilitate the redevelopment, by strengthening Delancey's hand in ongoing negotiations with various stakehlders, such as TfL and would have been considered on the 24 March, but for the coronavirus lockdown.  The meeting will be held remotely, but we understand with no live-streaming.

The meeting is also set to approve [a report that will override](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/mgIssueHistoryHome.aspx?IId=50021995) local residents legal rights, should they suffer a loss of light because of the redevelopment.  A [third report](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s88157/Report%20EC%20Shopping%20Centre%20Progress.pdf) will approve the £200,000 relocation assistance for traders, recently announced.

## Residents lose legal right

As we reported in [our last blogpost](http://35percent.org/2020-03-23-shopping-centre-compulsory-purchase-order/) Southwark intends [to lease](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s88163/Report%20EC%20CPO.pdf) both the shopping centre and London College of Communications themselves.  Subleasing arrangements will return the shopping centre and LCC back to the control Delancey and University of the Arts London, but as 'public property', residents legal 'right-to-light' options can be overridden.  Residents will [no longer be able to seek](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s88172/Report%20EC%20Property%20Rights.pdf) an injunction against the development (while remaining able to claim compensation).  Southwark say that there will be no cost to the Council from their leasing arrangements, but the report supplies no figures. 

## 72% say keep the centre open 

Both extraordinary measures illustrate Southwark's determination to support Delancey's redevelopment of the shopping centre, despite the shortfall in social rented housing and the mass displacement of traders.  Local charity and advocates of behalf of all traders Latin Elephant [estimates over half](http://35percent.org/2020-01-20-elephant-traders-still-homeless/) still have nowhere to go.  

It also follows a [survey conducted by the SE1](https://twitter.com/se1/status/1240692710987558913) news website that shows 72% of local people want the centre kept open, in the light of the Coronavirus public health crisis. [In response]https://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/10180?(utm_source=SE1+Direct&utm_campaign=0c3a7afe5a-SE1+Direct+1000&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_9d1f71fd65-0c3a7afe5a-407867973) Delancey have waived rent and service charges (a long-standing traders' demand), but reitereated]() that they still intend to close the shopping centre on 31 July, while making pharmacy and food supplies available, if the public health crisis continues.

## What we say...

The Up the Elephant Campaign, supported by the 35% Campaign, has consistently opposed Delancey's shopping centre redevelopment scheme, since its inception, over 3 years ago.  We support the ongoing legal challange to quash Delancey's planning permission.

Over time various concessions, dragged out of Delancey by campaigners, have made marginal improvements to the redevelopment.  Southwark's pledged £200,000 for the traders is also welcome, but Delancey's scheme still remains a bad one. Delancey are displacing an entire community of traders, and destroying a social hub for the many working people from all over the world who have made the Elephant their home.  The new development will have a miserly 116 social rented homes, out of nearly a thousand new units (if they ever get delivered).

So, Southwark Council should not be bending over backwards helping Delancey, by assuming CPO powers, in any circumstances, and certainly not now when half the traders still have nowhere to go and what was an already serious trading situation has been rendered dire by the Coronavirus crisis.

The UP THE ELEPHANT CAMPAIGN HAS MADE THE FOLLOWING DEMANDS;

1. Release the promised £200,000 support as cash grants to traders immediately;
2. Do not support the use of Compulsory Purchase Order powers on Delancey’s behalf
to facilitate the development. It should be by agreement between the development
stakeholders, not forced by Southwark Council;
3. Do not close the Elephant Shopping Centre until all traders have been relocated;
4. Give all traders more money to support them through this difficult time, and
5. Support the local community, not Delancey.
