title: Shopping centre CPO - Southwark ploughs on regardless
---
## Cabinet set to assume CPO powers this Tuesday

Southwark Council is set was to assume Compulsory Purchase Order (CPO) powers, on behalf of shopping centre developer Delancey at its reconvened Cabinet meeting, this Tues 7 April.  The move would facilitate the redevelopment, by strengthening Delancey's hand in ongoing negotiations with various stakehlders, such as TfL and was to have been considered last week, but for the coronavirus lockdown.  The meeting will be held remotely, but without video-livestreaming.

The meeting is also set to appove a report that will overide local residents legal rights, should they suffer a loss of light because of the development (residents would remain entitled to claim compersation).  A third report will rubberstamp the Â£200,000 relocation assistance, recently announced.
