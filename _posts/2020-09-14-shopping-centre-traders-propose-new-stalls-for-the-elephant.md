subtitle: Traders appeal to Mayor Sadiq Khan for his support

Traders who will be losing their market stalls when the Elephant and Castle shopping closes have come up with [their own proposal for new stalls](https://latinelephant.org/elephant-castle-relocation-proposal/) at the Elephant. Around forty traders face the loss of their businesses and livelihoods when the Centre closes its doors for the last time on 24 September.

The [traders’ proposals](https://latinelephant.org/elephant-castle-relocation-proposal/) are for new stalls to be sited around the Faraday Memorial, by the railway arches along Archer St and outside the new Elephant Arcade, at the bottom of Perronet House.

Traders are proposing at least 45 new stalls.  Most of the new stalls would be around the large silver Faraday Memorial in the middle of the Elephant roundabout. This will become an even more important commuter route between the train station and the tube stations, with the closure of the shopping centre.  The proposal would keep established traders at the heart of the Elephant and maintain the ‘sense of place’ that they have created.  The proposal builds upon a [previous Transport for London (TfL) project](https://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/7961), from 2014, but never delivered.

The proposal has been sent to the Mayor of London for his support.  The land around the Faraday memorial is owned by TfL, which the Mayor leads.

Local London Assembly member Florence Eshalomi MP has submitted a [formal question to the Mayor](https://twitter.com/se1/status/1303737672565960706/photo/1) asking him if he will support the proposals.

Traders are also looking for support from local councillors from all parties and representatives at the London Assembly.

Traders believe that with wholehearted support from the Mayor, Southwark Council, councillors and London Assembly members, all the displaced traders from the shopping centre can be found new homes. [Only 45 out of 97 traders had secured relocation space](http://35percent.org/2020-08-31-southwark-responds-to-shopping-centre-campaigners/), up to the end of April 2020.

The proposal was devised by Alice Chilangwa Farmer and is supported by the Up the Elephant Campaign, Latin Elephant and Southwark Law Centre.  If adopted it would provide shopping options and continuity to a local community facing a prolonged period of disruption and construction work.

The complete proposal can be found [here](https://latinelephant.org/elephant-castle-relocation-proposal/).

This is what the traders and supporters have to say;

Trader Shapoor Amini says: ‘ I’ve worked at this market since 2001. These people promised us so many things, they said we’ll give you a space, we’ll look after you guys, but they’ve done nothing for us. …I applied so many times—I’ve made calls, been to the council, been to the office, done lots of paperwork […] been to countless meetings, and still nothing.  My whole life has been spent in this market, in this area, and now I don’t know what to do…..I have a kids, a wife it is very difficult’.

Trader Edmund Attoh says: ‘I’m working here over 20 years. Things are very difficult people who have been here for a long time didn’t get nothing. That’s what we don’t understand, that’s why we are frustrated. We don’t know where we are going now. I applied for a space, and anything they asked, we give to them. They turned us down. But they didn’t say [why].’

Traders Mathew and Eden Onuba say: ‘We’ve been 5 years at Elephant and Castle. We don’t know what to do in September, it is a very difficult situation. I don’t want much, but to save the business we’ve built up together.’
