title: Shopping Centre traders propose new stalls for the Elephant
subtitle: Traders appeal to Mayor Sadiq Khan for his support

Traders who will be losing their market stalls when the Elephant and Castle shopping closes have come up with their own proposal for new stalls at the Elephant. Around forty traders face the loss of their businesses and livelihoods when the Centre closes its doors for the last time on 24 September.
The traders’ proposals are for new stalls to be sited around the Faraday Memorial, by the railway arches along Archer St and outside the new Elephant Arcade, at the bottom of Perronet House.

Traders are proposing at least 45 new stalls.  Most of the new stalls would be around the large silver Faraday Memorial in the middle of the Elephant roundabout. This will become an even more important commuter route between the train station and the tube stations, with the closure of the shopping centre.  The proposal would keep established traders at the heart of the Elephant and maintain the ‘sense of place’ that they have created.  The proposal builds upon a previous Transport for London (TfL) project, from 2014, but never delivered.

The proposal has been sent to the Mayor of London for his support.  The land around the Faraday memorial is owned by TfL, which the Mayor leads.
Local London Assembly member Florence Eshalomi MP has submitted a formal question to the Mayor asking him if he will support the proposals.
Traders are also looking for support from local councillors from all parties and representatives at the London Assembly.
