Southwark Council [announced](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/news/2017/apr/stunning-new-council-homes-become-ready-for-local-tenantslast) last week that 56 new council homes have been provided by a new private development at Blackfriars Circus and that they are a step towards achieving the Council's ambition to build 11000 new council homes over the next 30 years.

The reality of this claim is worth examining.

The [__Blackfriars Circus__](http://www.barratthomes.co.uk/new-homes/greater-london/H625601-Blackfriars-circus/) 
development overlooks the South Bank University campus at the Elephant & Castle and comprises 336 new homes in 5 buildings, ranging up to 27 storeys 
in height, the tallest of which will be known as __'The Conquest Apartments'__. 

The scheme should have provided about 70 social rented homes and 47 shared ownership, in accordance with Southwark's affordable housing policy. However, in time-honoured fashion the developer, Barratt Homes, submitted a viability assessment, claiming that only 30% affordable housing was  viable, consisting of 35 shared-ownership homes,8 social rented and 48 affordable rent, at 65% market rent. 

The [officer's report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!5wmNTTJlhAE1P%2fSH390aXg%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) 
explains that the viability assessment had been appraised by the 
'Borough Valuer' (meaning the District Valuer) and that _"Whilst a number of inputs into the valuation have been agreed.... an agreement has not been reached on two fundamental matters: methodology of calculating the benchmark value of the site; and residential sale values. As such, the applicant and the Borough Valuer have not reached an agreed position about how much affordable housing can be delivered on site."_ (para. 109.  In fact the District Valuer's view was clear and is related in the s106 agreement, which states ['..the District Valuer concluded... the Development could support the minimum housing requirement'](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!EO9aOXw4U1fRhx%2f8lcgyPw%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d)[^1].

The planning report proposed an additional in lieu payment of £4.7m to make up the affordable shortfall.  The application was approved, with the in lieu payment bumped [up to £4.9m](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!EO9aOXw4U1fRhx%2f8lcgyPw%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) in the S106 agreement, signed in November 2014 [^2].

In September 2015 it was [reported](http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/8441) that the council was to buy the 8 social and 48 affordable rented homes from Barratt for £10m, in order to turn them into council homes.  The units were purchased and duly listed as 128 – 150 Blackfriars Road, amongst the schemes that will deliver Southwark's [11000 new council homes](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s62949/Appendix%201B%20List%20of%20Approved%20Schemes.pdf).

But instead of paying £10m for 56 council homes Southwark could have stood firm and insisted that the social rented housing was delivered on site, thereby securing 70 social rented units at no cost to itself and saving £10m to spend on new council homes elsewhere.

Further, this is not council housing, if as Southwark says in its [press release](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/news/2017/apr/stunning-new-council-homes-become-ready-for-local-tenantslast) the rent is 40% market rent. A calculation based on the Council's [latest market data](http://www.2.southwark.gov.uk/downloads/download/4454/southwark_housing_market_trends_bulletin) gives an average rent of £235 across all flat sizes compared to an [average Council rent of under £100 per week](http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/london-borough-to-limit-average-rent-to-below-100-per-week/7005006.article).

What we could be seeing here is the introduction of two-tier council housing; Southwark has recently [introduced](/img/lbsprwaitinglist.pdf)an 'intermediate waiting list' with higher rents, specifically for 'affordable rented' housing supplied by new developments. Southwark will allocate the tenants from this new list and they will pay a discounted market rent, higher than council rent but Southwark will still claim that they are new council homes. 

END

Either of these amounts appears over the odds, compared to the [£3.1m paid](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/LR_LANDQ_TrafalgarPlace.pdf) by L&Q for the 54 affordable homes bought from Heygate developer Lend Lease at [Trafalgar Place](http://trafalgarplace.com). Southwark are also using seight of hand by including the number in their promised 11000 council homes, when they are in fact a private developer's affordable housing obligation.

New apartments in [Dephini apartments](https://www.barratthomes.co.uk/new-homes/greater-london/H625601-Blackfriars-circus/), the latest phase of Barratt's [__Blackfriars Circus__](http://www.barratthomes.co.uk/new-homes/greater-london/H625601-Blackfriars-circus/) development have been available since the beginning of the year, but there are still some available, if you hurry, starting at £595k for a studio flat.

Barratt Homes is Britains third-largest housebuilder, and [it made £321m](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2017/02/22/profits-rise-barratt-despite-uks-biggest-housebuilder-building/ in the first half of 2016) before tax in the second half of last year, a profit rise of 9%. This continued Barrett's steady profit climb since 2010, [part of the explosion of housebuilders' profits](http://www.ourcity.london/issues/viability/house_builders_profits/) over the past five years. 

Barratt's success is due in part to its pipeline of major developments in Southwark, which include [__Maple Quays__](http://www.barratthomes.co.uk/new-homes/greater-london/h469201-maple-quays/) (668 homes in phase 1 of the [Canada Water regeneration](/canada-water/)); [__the Galleria__](http://www.barratthomes.co.uk/new-homes/greater-london/track-record---article-pages/the-galleria/) development in Peckham; [__Redwood Park__](http://www.barratthomes.co.uk/new-homes/greater-london/h309201-redwood-park/) (212 homes on former council land at Surrey Quays) and the 60-acre, 3,500-home Aylesbury estate redevelompent for which Barratt is Notting Hill Housing's [development partner](http://www.nottinghillhousing.org.uk/our-developments/aylesbury-estate-southwark).
