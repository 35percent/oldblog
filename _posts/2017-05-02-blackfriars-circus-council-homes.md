New apartments in [Dephini apartments](https://www.barratthomes.co.uk/new-homes/greater-london/H625601-Blackfriars-circus/), the latest phase of Barratt's [__Blackfriars Circus__](http://www.barratthomes.co.uk/new-homes/greater-london/H625601-Blackfriars-circus/) development have been available since the beginning of the year, but there are still some available, if you hurry, starting at £595k for a studio flat.

Barratt Homes is Britains third-largest housebuilder, and [it made £321m](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2017/02/22/profits-rise-barratt-despite-uks-biggest-housebuilder-building/ in the first half of 2016) before tax in the second half of last year, a profit rise of 9%. This continued Barrett's steady profit climb since 2010, [part of the explosion of housebuilders' profits](http://www.ourcity.london/issues/viability/house_builders_profits/) over the past five years. 

Barratt's success is due in part to its pipeline of major developments in Southwark, which include [__Maple Quays__](http://www.barratthomes.co.uk/new-homes/greater-london/h469201-maple-quays/) (668 homes in phase 1 of the [Canada Water regeneration](/canada-water/)); [__the Galleria__](http://www.barratthomes.co.uk/new-homes/greater-london/track-record---article-pages/the-galleria/) development in Peckham; [__Redwood Park__](http://www.barratthomes.co.uk/new-homes/greater-london/h309201-redwood-park/) (212 homes on former council land at Surrey Quays) and the 60-acre, 3,500-home Aylesbury estate redevelompent for which Barratt is Notting Hill Housing's [development partner](http://www.nottinghillhousing.org.uk/our-developments/aylesbury-estate-southwark).


The [__Blackfriars Circus__](http://www.barratthomes.co.uk/new-homes/greater-london/H625601-Blackfriars-circus/) 
development overlooks the South Bank University campus at the Elephant & Castle and comprises 336 new homes in 5 buildings, ranging up to 27 storeys 
in height. 
According to [SE1 website](http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/8441) the 
tallest of these will be known as __'The Conquest Apartments'__. 

This is an appropriate name for a development that was able to dupe Southwark council into waiving the tenure requirements of its 35% affordable housing Policy. These 
would have secured 70 social rented homes and 47 shared ownership, but 
Barratt submitted a viability assessment claiming that only 30% affordable housing was  viable, comprising 35 shared-ownership homes,8 social rented and 48 affordable rent, at 65% market rent. 

The [officer's report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!5wmNTTJlhAE1P%2fSH390aXg%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) 
explains that the council had the viability assessment appraised by the 
'Borough Valuer' (meaning the District Valuer) and that _"Whilst a number of inputs into the valuation have been agreed.... an agreement has not been reached on two fundamental matters: methodology of calculating the benchmark value of the site; and residential sale values. As such, the applicant and the Borough Valuer have not reached an agreed position about how much affordable housing can be delivered on site."_ (para. 109.  In fact the District Valuer's view was clear and is related in the s106 agreement, which states ['..the District Valuer concluded... the Development could support the minimum housing requirement'](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!EO9aOXw4U1fRhx%2f8lcgyPw%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d)[^1].

The planning report proposed an additional in lieu payment of £4.7m to make up the affordable shortfall.  The application was approved, with the in lieu payment bumped [up to £4.9m](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!EO9aOXw4U1fRhx%2f8lcgyPw%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) in the S106 agreement, signed in November 2014 [^2].

However, in September 2015 it was [reported](http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/8441) that the council was planning to buy these 8 social and 48 affordable rented homes from Barratt, in order to turn them into social rented council homes at a cost of £10m.  The site has duly appeared, as 128 – 150 Blackfriars Road, on the list of schemes that will make up Southwark's [11000 council homes](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s62949/Appendix%201B%20List%20of%20Approved%20Schemes.pdf).

So it appears that Southwark has got at least 56 social rented homes from Blackfriars Circus after all, but at a net cost of either £10m, or £5.1m, if it got its S106 payment from Barrett.

Either of these amounts appears over the odds, compared to the [£3.1m paid](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/LR_LANDQ_TrafalgarPlace.pdf) by L&Q for the 54 affordable homes bought from Heygate developer Lend Lease at [Trafalgar Place](http://trafalgarplace.com). Southwark are also using seight of hand by including the number in their promised 11000 council homes, when they are in fact a private developer's affordable housing obligation.
