title: The reality for traders relocating from Elephant and Castle Shopping Centre
---
## Nearly half surveyed have no space.

Southwark Law Centre (SLC) has written to Southwark Council to detail the shortcomings of the relocation of the present traders from the Elephant shopping centre, prior to its demolition on July 31 2020.
The letter is supported by Latin Elephant and Up the Elephant, which includes the 35% Campaign.

In the letter SLC has said.....
It calls upon Southwark.. support
SLC has also supplied Southwark with the details of a survey conducted before the Coronavirus lockdown.  The survey a snapshot of what is happening; of the ten traders surveyed, four had not been offered a relocation space and the remaining six said that the spaces offered, in Perronet House and Castle Square, were unsuitable, mainly because they were too small, but also because they were in poor locations for attracting trade and had no space for storage of for displaying their goods.

All the respondents came from black and ethnic minority backgrounds.  After much prompting from Latin Elephant and objectors, Southwark has been diligent in conducting EqIA, but now that we appear to be approaching the end of the shopping centre's life and the reality of the redevelopment is finally hitting traders, we can see how limited the mitigation provided by the relocation strategy actually is... AECOM EiA true function revealed - to allow Southwark to pat itself on the back, and are fulfil legal requirements; practical value is a distant consideration.


This is a small survey, but it's finding are reinforced by the much larger research of Latin Elephant/petit Elephant, which tracked 150 businesses (check).  This also found that over half of businesses would not find space in the new development.

No surprise, recap planning report; objections...



## The forgotten

Bingo hall, those who have left...

## Perronet House - service charge, but no service

Other obstacles and irritations - already blogged; higher rent and servcice charge; owned by Southwark, unlike Castle Sq,  HRA, managed by 'meanwhile' peculiar arrangement at Perronet Houseyearly review





A big part of the redevelopment of the shopping centre is the relocation of the present traders to four new sites â€“ Perronet House, Castle Square, Elephant One and Elephant Park.
