title: The reality for traders relocating from Elephant and Castle Shopping Centre
---
## Nearly half surveyed have no space.

Southwark Law Centre (SLC) has written to Southwark Council to detail the shortcomings of the relocation of the present traders from the Elephant shopping centre, prior to its demolition on July 31 2020.
The letter is supported by Latin Elephant and Up the Elephant, which includes the 35% Campaign.

In the letter SLC has said.....poor TS support...
It calls upon Southwark.. support
SLC has also supplied Southwark with the details of a survey conducted before the Coronavirus lockdown.  The survey a snapshot of what is happening; of the ten traders surveyed, four had not been offered a relocation space and the remaining six said that the spaces offered, in Perronet House and Castle Square, were unsuitable, mainly because they were too small, but also because they were in poor locations for attracting trade and had no space for storage of for displaying their goods.

## Loyalty 

The longest serving trader surveyed has been at the Elephant for 22 years.  The longest serving trader not offered relocation space has been at the Elephant 15 years; together all ten traders clock up over 115 years at the shopping centre.

All the respondents came from black and ethnic minority backgrounds.  
In their comments all the respondents say the same thing - more money is needed, and more space, and if the space cannot be found then compensation should be offered. Quotes....

The SLC survey is a relatively small, but it's finding are reinforced by the much larger research of Latin Elephant/petit Elephant, which tracked 150 businesses (check).  This also found that over half of businesses would not find space in the new development.

No surprise, recap planning report; objections...

## Crisis - what crisis?

Southwark approved £200,000 (good), but at the same time did Delancey the huge favour of adopting CPO powers and leasing both the shopping centre and the LCC, to overide residents legal rights.  While Southwark claim that is at nil cost to itself, it looks like it will be of considerable financial benefit to Delancey, who would not otherewise have been able to secure the necessary funding for their redevelopment scheme.

Hardship fund £2m - but 10,000 microbusinesses, flexibility promised, but overall report detached from reality - written before lockdown and makes no reference to it; makes no additional provision for C lockdown

It did this without insisting that Delancey improve its own support for traders.  The relocation fund remains £634,700; Delancey still insist on closure on 31 July; despite SE1 survey, minor concessions.

Traders still being asked for 3 quotes for fitting costs; TS suport severly hit, alreaddy the subclosed shop because of Coronavirus, reportedly holding online meetings, many traders nonetheless feel cut adrift

After much prompting from Latin Elephant and objectors, Southwark has been diligent in conducting EqIA, but now that we appear to be approaching the end of the shopping centre's life and the reality of the redevelopment is finally hitting traders, we can see how limited the mitigation provided by the relocation strategy actually is... AECOM EiA true function revealed - to allow Southwark to pat itself on the back, and are fulfil legal requirements; practical value is a distant consideration.

## The forgotten

Bingo hall, those who have left...

## Perronet House - service charge, but no service

Other obstacles and irritations - already blogged; higher rent and servcice charge; owned by Southwark, unlike Castle Sq,  HRA, managed by 'meanwhile' peculiar arrangement at Perronet Houseyearly review

## Demands
No closure before traders sorted out.  Not a formality, or just an inevitable outcome of Coroanavirus lockdown.  if the redevelopment is to be one, where no=one is left behind





A big part of the redevelopment of the shopping centre is the relocation of the present traders to four new sites – Perronet House, Castle Square, Elephant One and Elephant Park.
