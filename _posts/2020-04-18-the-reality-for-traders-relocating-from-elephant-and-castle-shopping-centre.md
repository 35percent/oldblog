title: 'The harsh reality of relocation for shopping centre traders '
---
## Law centre survey shows that nearly half of traders have no space.

The [Southwark Law Centre](http://www.southwarklawcentre.org.uk/) (SLC) has written to Southwark Council, detailing the shortcomings of the relocation of the independent traders from the Elephant & Castle shopping centre, prior to its demolition on 31 July 2020.
The letter is supported by Latin Elephant and Up the Elephant, which includes the 35% Campaign.

SLC's letter (link) supplies Southwark with the details of a survey of traders about the relocation, conducted just before the Coronavirus lockdown.  This 'snapshot' survey of ten traders shows that four had not been offered a relocation space and the remaining were offered the spaces that were inadequate, mainly because they were too small, but also because they were in poor locations for attracting trade and had no space for storage or for displaying their goods.

The letter also criticises Tree Shepherd, the traders' appointed business advisor, for a lack of appropriate support, particularly during the lockdown.  The relocation fund is described as not fit for purpose and the relocation database of limited value.  It regrets that Southwark approved using CPO powers on Delancey's behalf, without any increase to the Delancey relocation fund.

The letter also notes that work on completing Castle Square had stopped and asks how this will impact on the traders' relocation.  This is one of the four relocation sites and due to open in June.

The letter acknowledges that Southwark is not able to control the wider economic circumstances, but nonetheless calls on them to give stronger and more effective support to the traders.


## Loyalty 

The longest serving trader surveyed has been at the Elephant for 22 years.  The longest serving trader not offered relocation space has been at the Elephant 15 years; together all ten traders clock up over 115 years at the shopping centre.

All the respondents came from black and ethnic minority backgrounds.  
In their comments all the respondents say the same thing - more money is needed, and more space, and if the space cannot be found then compensation should be offered. Quotes....

The SLC survey is a relatively small, but it's finding are reinforced by the much larger research of Latin Elephant/petit Elephant, which tracked 150 businesses (check).  This also found that over half of businesses would not find space in the new development.

No surprise, recap planning report; objections...

It contrasts with Southwark's rather rosier assessment of the relocation process. This is light on numbers for those actually relocated, preferring instead percentage measures of trader confidence.  One set of figures that do stand out is that of 64 applications for three of the four main relocation sites, 28 have been rejected; Southwark gives no explanation for either this or what exactly it expects these 28 businesses to do.

No figures are given for the actual amounts granted or distributed.

## Crisis - what crisis?

Southwark approved £200,000 (good), but at the same time did Delancey the huge favour of adopting CPO powers and leasing both the shopping centre and the LCC, to overide residents legal rights.  While Southwark claim that is at nil cost to itself, it looks like it will be of considerable financial benefit to Delancey, who would not otherewise have been able to secure the necessary funding for their redevelopment scheme.

Hardship fund £2m - but 10,000 microbusinesses, flexibility promised, but overall report detached from reality - written before lockdown and makes no reference to it; makes no additional provision for C lockdown

It did this without insisting that Delancey improve its own support for traders.  The relocation fund remains £634,700; Delancey still insist on closure on 31 July; despite SE1 survey, minor concessions.

Traders still being asked for 3 quotes for fitting costs; TS suport severly hit, alreaddy the subclosed shop because of Coronavirus, reportedly holding online meetings, many traders nonetheless feel cut adrift

After much prompting from Latin Elephant and objectors, Southwark has been diligent in conducting EqIA, but now that we appear to be approaching the end of the shopping centre's life and the reality of the redevelopment is finally hitting traders, we can see how limited the mitigation provided by the relocation strategy actually is... AECOM EiA true function revealed - to allow Southwark to pat itself on the back, and are fulfil legal requirements; practical value is a distant consideration.

## The forgotten

Bingo hall, those who have left...

## Perronet House - service charge, but no service

Other obstacles and irritations - already blogged; higher rent and servcice charge; owned by Southwark, unlike Castle Sq,  HRA, managed by 'meanwhile' peculiar arrangement at Perronet Houseyearly review

## Demands
No closure before traders sorted out.  Not a formality, or just an inevitable outcome of Coroanavirus lockdown.  if the redevelopment is to be one, where no=one is left behind

## Report on progress - Public support for scheme falls
While the report confirms the welcome £200,000 fund set up by Southwark it takes no account of the entirely new, desperate circumstances of the Coronavirus pandemic.  The report is dated 24 March and could have been excused for not addressing the impact of the Coronavirus, were it not that it was considered on 7 April,  two weeks after lockdown, without any amendment, addendum or change.  The most ludicrous consequence is that the report recommends continuing with the 'Follow the Herd' publicity campaign, no doubt well-meaning when it was concieved, but hardly in step now with the new era of social distancing.  The campaign's aim is to counteract the fall in public approval of the scheme,from 67% in 2016 to 42% now, with a rise of opposition from 6% to 14%,  with the main concern being what is happening to the traders.

Delancey additional relocation costs - hardship fund - App D

Traders had already been relieved of rent and service charge payments, but the complete lack of trade needs to be reconised by increased levels of relocation support; the measures in place at the moment are not enough.

Certainty.

## Stall holders
While main centre traders now have 100% discount, stall-holders in the surrounding 'moat' have complained that is the market operator, Urban Space Management, who has benefited most from this reduction, hihc has not been fully passed to them.  App



A big part of the redevelopment of the shopping centre is the relocation of the present traders to four new sites – Perronet House, Castle Square, Elephant One and Elephant Park.
