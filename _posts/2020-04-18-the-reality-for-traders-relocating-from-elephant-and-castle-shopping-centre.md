title: The reality for traders relocating from Elephant and Castle Shopping Centre
---
## Nearly half surveyed have no space.

Southwark Law Centre (SLC) has written to Southwark Council to detail the shortcomings of the relocation of the present traders from the Elephant shopping centre, prior to its demolition on July 31 2020.
The letter is supported by Latin Elephant and Up the Elephant, which includes the 35% Campaign.

In the letter SLC has said.....

SLC has also supplied Southwark with the details of a survey conducted before the Coronavirus lockdown.  The survey a snapshot of what is happening; of the ten traders surveyed, four had not been offered a relocation space and the remaining six said that the spaces offered, in Perronet House and Castle Square, were unsuitable, mainly because they were too small, but also because they were in poor locations for attracting trade and had no space for storage of for displaying their goods.

A big part of the redevelopment of the shopping centre is the relocation of the present traders to four new sites â€“ Perronet House, Castle Square, Elephant One and Elephant Park.
