## Survey shows over two-thirds of current traders have nowhere to go.

Research by charity [Latin Elephant](https://latinelephant.org/) has shown that only 36 (?) out of 100 (?) current independent traders at the Elephant and Castle Shopping Centre have been allocated new premises to replace those being lost to the redevelopment of the shopping centre.

Latin Elephant has been tracking the movement of the traders since December 2018 and in conjunction with [petit elephant](), showing each trader's fate. Their webpage  has an [interactive map](https://latinelephant.org/map/#Q5), accompanied by a narrative of the decline in trader's number over time, up to the early summer 2019.  Latin Elephant estimates that four or five further businesses have been lost since then and that the total number of current traders will fall from 130 (January 2018) to 36, if the relocation strategy for the traders continues on its present course.  

The figure of 130 independant traders (ie traders with less than three outlets) was [supplied by Southwark Council](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DwEQ6HqW0AEbC6W.jpg:large) in January 2018.  These including market stallholders and businesses in Hannibal House, the office block above the centre, and all lie within the so-called 'red-line' of the proposed redevelopment area.  Latin Elephant then conducted its own survey in December 2018 which found [only 97 remained](https://latinelephant.org/map/#Q7), indicating a loss of 30 traders over the year.

In February 2019, Southwark responded to [a Freedom OF Information](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/independently_owned_retail_busin?nocache=incoming-1334948#incoming-1334948) request, with a [database](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/555280/response/1334948/attach/2/190321%20For%20FOI%20EC%20traders.pdf%201037530.pdf) of 79 independent businesses; Latin Elephant identified a further [21 businesses omitted](https://latinelephant.org/map/#Q7) from this.

Regardless of the conflicting information, in March 2019, a Southwark confirmed that [only 36](https://twitter.com/kieronjwilliams/status/1108781273630289920?s=12) of those traders remaining, however many that might be, had been offered a relocation unit.

## Not enough relocation space

On the other side of the equation [Latin Elephant identify](https://latinelephant.org/map/#Q7) 46 retail units available for traders, over three sites (Perronet House, Elephant One, and Castle Square).  A further 8 units should also be available on the Elephant Park development (formerly the Heygate estate), with about the same number available at a later date. Thirty market pitches in East St market have also been suggested, but this is nearly a mile away.

So, in the best-case scenario, and discounting the East St market pitches, there is only just about half the number of units that are needed to accommodate the remaining traders.  This estimate is based on the unrealistic assumption that the units under offer are an exact match to the requirements of the traders eg the size, cost, location, use-class etc; this will obviously not be the case and when this fact is put into the equation the available options of suitable new premises for each trader diminish significantly.

## Not enough money

Another obstacle to successful relocation is the cost of moving, fitting-out new premises and re-establishing the business.  The relocation fund provided by Delancey stands at [£634,700](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/regeneration/elephant-and-castle?chapter=20), with a vague commitment to an unspecified greater amount, if it is needed.  This averages out at a modest £17,630 per trader, given 36 traders and a very modest £6,340, given the hundred current traders.  In fact, the costs will of course vary, according to size and other needs and at least one trader has been quoted a fit-out cost of £xxx (EXAMPLE).

## Feeble enforcement from Southwark Council

The trader' relocation strategy was inadequate from the start, with too little space to move to and too little money to do it with, but it has been made worse by ineffectual enforcement by  Southwark Council.

The relocation process is effectively controlled by Delancey and, in the case of Elephant Park premises, fellow developer Lendlease. Both [developers have obligations](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/regeneration/elephant-and-castle?chapter=20) to provide affordable retail premises to shopping centre traders, under their respective legal s106 development agreements with Southwark Council.  Southwark therefore has the power to take action if it thinks that these obligations are not being fulfilled.  Traders complain that this is indeed the case, with shopping centre traders not fitting the profile required by Delancey and Lendlease for the new Elephant developments.  Southwark Law Centre has taken up the case of one trader, refused premises because of the nature of his trade. (OTHER EXAMPLES?)

Even those traders who have been allocated space have justifiable complaints about its size, cost and position - all critical factors for successfully continuing business.  There are particular complaints about one of the relocation sites, Perronet House.  Despite being owned by Southwark Council, who is thus the traders new landlord, the service charges will be higher there than those for Castle House, the relocation site owned by Delancey. (FIGURES?)

## Twenty eight traders refused relocation premises

Several FOI requests have been made to Southwark, in pursuit of information about the traders' relocation. The [latest request](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/independent_traders_in_elephant?unfold=1#incoming-1456513) is for information about which traders have succeeded in their relocation requests (thirty-six in number), those refused (28 in number), those who have left the Elephant and Castle, plus the 130 Elephant traders initially identified by Southwark, back in January 2018.  Perhaps unsurprisingly this requst has been refused, on the grounds that it would prejudice the commercial interests of third parties and awaits the outcome of an appeal, against the decision.

## A bad tale continues

An Evening Standard article, enthusiastically [endorsed by Southwark Council leader Peter John](https://twitter.com/peterjohn6/status/1214971921277890560), tells the shopping centre redevelopment story that developer Delancey wants the world  to believe in - new homes, new jobs, 'funky street food'.  Through their diligent research Latin Elephant and petit elephant tell a different story; one of [neglect and broken promises](http://35percent.org/2017-04-02-traders-charter-broken-promises/). The independent  traders, their families, customers and the social fabric they have built over many years is being pulled apart to enable this 'bright future'. 

But it is not too late for Southwark to at least partly redeem themselves (though it may take a different leader) - the traders need more space and more money for their relocation fund.  Delancey (and Lendlease) are well able to provide it.  Delancey's anticipated profit from the shopping centre redevelopment is at [least £137.1m](http://35percent.org/2018-07-02-viability-and-delancey/).

There will be a [demonstration, organised by Up The Elephan campaign](https://twitter.com/UpTheElephant_), in support of the traders on at Southwark Council's first assembly meeting of the year on **Tuesday 28 January Southwark Council Head Offices, Tooley St 6pm** - everyone who wants a fairer, inclusive regeneration at the Elephant is welcome.
