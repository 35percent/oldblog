## Survey shows over two-thirds of current traders have nowhere to go.

Research by charity [Latin Elephant](https://latinelephant.org/) has shown that only 36 (?) out of 100 (?) current independent traders at the Elpehant and Castle Shopping Centre have been allocated new premises to replace those being lost to the redevelopment of the shopping centre.

Latin Elephant has been tracking the movement of the traders since December 2018 and in conjunction with [petit elephant](https://twitter.com/elephant_petit) has produced an [interactive map](https://latinelephant.org/map/#Q5), showing each trader's fate. The webpage also gives a narrative of the decline trader's number over time, up to the early summer 2019.  Latin Elephant estimates that four or five further buinesses have been lost since the then and that the total number of current traders will fall from 130 (January 2018) to 36, if the relocation strategy for the traders follows its present course.  

According to figures supplied by Southwark Council in January 2018 the shopping centre held around 130 independant traders (ie traders with less than three outlets).  These including market stallholders and businessses in Hannibal House, the office block above the centre, all lying within the so-called 'red-line' of the proposed redevelopment area.  Latin Elephant then conducted its own survey in December 2018 which found only 97 remained, indicating a loss of 30 traders over the year.

In February 2019, Southwark responded to [a Freedom OF Information](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/independently_owned_retail_busin?nocache=incoming-1334948#incoming-1334948) request, with a [database](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/555280/response/1334948/attach/2/190321%20For%20FOI%20EC%20traders.pdf%201037530.pdf) of 79 independant businesses; Latin Elephant identified a further [21 businesses omitted](https://latinelephant.org/map/#Q7) from this.

However many there may have been, In 21 March 2019, a Southwark Cabinet Member confirmed that [only 36 businesses](https://twitter.com/kieronjwilliams/status/1108781273630289920?s=12) of those remaining had been offered a relocation unit.

## Not enough relocation space

On the other side of the equation Latin Elephant identify 46 retail units available for traders, over three sites (Perronet House, Elephant One, and Castle Square).  A further 8 units should also be available on the Elephant Park development (formerly the Heygate estate), with about the same number available at a later date. Thirty market pitches in East St market have also been suggested, but these are a mile away.

So, in the best-case scenatrio, and discounting the East St market pitches, there is only just about half the number of units that are needed to accomodate the remaining traders.  This estimate, of course, is based on the unrealistic assumption that the units under offer are an exact match to the requirements of the traders eg the size, cost, location, use-class etc; when these factors are put into the equation the available options of suitable new premises for each trader diminish significantly.

## Not enough money

Another obstacle to successful relocation is the cost of moving, fitting-out new premises and reetablishing their busimess.  The relocation fund provided by Delancey stands at £634,700, with a vague commitment to an unspecified greater amount, if it is needed.  This averages out at a modest £17,630 per trader, given 36 traders and a very modest £6,340 given the hundred current traders 

## Southwark refuse information 

Latin Elephant note

An Evening Standard article, enthusiastically retweeted by Southwark Council leader Peter John, tells the Elephant redevelopment story that developer Delancey wants the world  to believe - new homes, new jobs, bright new everything.  Latin Elephant and petit elephant through their diligent research shows that this is not a true picture - the traders, their families, customers and the social fabric they have built over many years is being pulled apart to enable this 'bright future'. 

Another bad tale of neglect and broken promises.  [Traders Charter](http://35percent.org/2017-04-02-traders-charter-broken-promises/).  Not too late for Southwark to at least partly redeem themselves - more space, more money for relocation fund
