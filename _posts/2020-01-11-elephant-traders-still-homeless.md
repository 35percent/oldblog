## Survey shows over two-thirds of current traders have nowhere to go.

Reseaarch by charity [Latin Elephant](https://latinelephant.org/) has shown that only 36 (?) out of 100 (?) current independent traders at the Elpehant and Castle Shopping Centre have been allocated new premises to replace those being lost to the redevelopment of the shopping centre.

Latin Elephant has been tracking the movement of the traders since December 2018 and in conjunction with [petit elephant](https://twitter.com/elephant_petit) has produced an [interactive map](https://latinelephant.org/map/#Q5), showing each trader's fate. The webpage also gives a narrative of the decline trader's number over time.

According to figures supplied by Southwark Council the shopping centre held around 130 independant traders in January 2018.  These including market stallholders and businessses in Hannibal House, the office block above the centre, all lying within the so-called 'red-line' of the proposed redevelopment area.  Latin Elephant then conducted its own survey in December 2018 which found only 97 remained, indicating a loss of 30 traders over the year.





developer Delancey embarked on its redevelopment plans back in 2014 (?).  the beginning of the submission of the findings are detailed in an interactive map and webpage and was posted

Another bad tale of neglect and broken promises.  [Traders Charter](http://35percent.org/2017-04-02-traders-charter-broken-promises/).  Not too late for Southwark to at least partly redeem themselves - more space, more money for relocation fund
