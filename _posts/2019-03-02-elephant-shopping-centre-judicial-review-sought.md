title: Elephant shopping centre - judicial review sought
---
## Crowdfunding appeal launched

A coalition of local people and groups fighting for a fairer regeneration at the Elephant and Castle, including the 35% Campaign, have made a legal application to overturn the planning approval for the redevelopment of the Elephant and Castle shopping centre.

The legal challenge argues that Southwark were misled by shopping centre owner and developer Delancey about the amount of the social rented housing that could be provided.  If the challenge is successful it would mean that the approval, awarded to Delancey by Southwark Council, would be quashed, stopping the demolition and redevelopment of the centre.

A crowdfunding appeal has been launched to help fund the challenge https://www.crowdjustice.com/case/stop-the-elephant-shopping-centre-destruction.  This follows two successful fundraisers, at Distriandina The Colombian Restaurant and Night Club Café and a film-night at Draper TRA hall.

The action is being mounted because while Delancey will be making a projected profit of £137m - £153m, their scheme will destroy and displace the local community – 

•	Most traders won’t get a place in the new development
•	There is no certainty over the future of the bingo
•	Delancey may not provide any social rented housing in this new luxury development – and there still is 		not enough of it.

Southwark's Council’s planning committee was misled as to the maximum amount of affordable housing the scheme could viably provide. While Delancey said it could only afford to provide 116 social rented units we now know that with Mayor’s funding they could give us another 42. That’s 42 families deprived of somewhere decent and affordable to live.

Even the 116 social rented homes promised could be at risk; the devil is in the detail and Delancey has managed to pull the wool over the Council's eyes with a deal which could leave us with little or no social rented housing if Delancey doesn’t deliver the “West site”, not due to be built for another 10 years.

We are challenging Delancey’s planning permission through the Planning Court.  We want the permission quashed and then we want a development scheme that provides homes and shops that are truly affordable for local people.

Our legal challenge is supported by the Public Interest Law Centre and Southwark Law Centre.  We will be represented by barristers Sarah Sackman of Francis Taylor Building and David Wolfe QC of Matrix Chambers.

But we must raise at least £5000 to be able to mount this vital challenge and for that we need your help. All funds will go towards the legal costs of the case. If we lose the case we will have to pay the other side's costs. If we win, we will be able to pay our own lawyers!
