title: Ledbury estate tenants face hard choices
---
## 

The beleagured tenants of the [Ledbury estate](https://www.ledburyestate.com/) face stiff increases in rent and council tax,if they take up an offer of new homes made by Southwark Council.  The homes are needed after an [Arups report](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/housing/safety-in-the-home/fire-safety-on-the-ledbury-estate?chapter=4) recommended strengthening the four tower blocks on the estate, works which would in all liklihood require the [residents to leave their homes](https://www.ledburyestate.com/single-post/2017/11/22/ARUP-engineers-report-on-Ledbury-published).  The Arup's report was commissioned by Southwark after persistent complaints by residents were finally heeded.  The residents' struggles, ably led by the Ledbury TRA and Ledbury Action Group, are chronicled in the excellent [LAG blog](https://www.ledburyestate.com/blog).

The 80 new homes are in Sylvan Grove and Southwark's purchase would go towards meeting their [pledge to build 1,500 council homes](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s72602/Report%20Proposed%20Acquisition%20of%20future%20affordable%20housing%20at%208%20-%2024%20Sylvan%20Grove%20SE15%201PE.pdf) by 2018.

[LAG](https://www.ledburyestate.com/blog) gives examples of total housing cost increases for tenants of 25% - 50%.  The council tax will be in a higher band, but the rent difference (of about £15-£20pw) is the consequence of a little noticed change in the [Council's rent-setting process](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s50449/Report%20HRA%20Budget%202015-16%20Indicative.pdf), made back in 2014.  In that year the government ended its vain attempt to raise council rents to housing association levels, through so-called 'target rents',introduced in 2001/2.  According to [Inside Housing](https://www.insidehousing.co.uk/insight/insight/missing-the-target-36408) only 55% of Southwark rents were then at the higher target rent, and Southwark decided that while the target would be abandoned for generak rent setting, it would retained for relets and new builds, such as Sylvan Court.

Southwark had sound financial reasons for this; like all councils it was entering a new 'self-financing' regime and had made its financial projections on the basis of the higher income provided by target rents.  Nonetheless the burden would be borne by tenants and in acknowledgement of this, Southwark allowed some exemptions, one of which was for tenants on regeneration estates.  This seems to have been forgotten though; Ledbury demands that they pay no more than they pay now have been rebuffed (link).  Strictly speaking Ledbury may not be a regeneration estate, but if the residents are subject to the same kind of involuntary moves they should surely be given the same consideration as such tenants.

Southwark's Tenants Council was consulted about the keeping target rents for relets and saw the danger of a two-tier rent system, gradually ratcheting all rents up as tenants changed (Southwark estaimated that this would be achieved after 20 years), and duly voted 14 to 3 against the change (link), but to no avail.  Unsurprisingly, there was no wider consultation.

The Ledbury case sheds a light on Southwark's pledge to build 11000 (15000) council homes.  A very welcome pledge, but if the new council housing proves to be too expensive for current council tenants, as demonstrated by the fact that Ledbury tenants are turning it down, then the fulfilled promise will turn out to be hollow.  If, also, along the way the term 'council housing' itself is being  stealthily redefined to allow different rent levels, then it will cease to be one tenure of affordabe housing that is trusted, readily understood and truly affordable.  Other new measures, such as the intermediate list, will help this dangerous process along, aided by the Mayor, Sadiq Khan, repeatedly equating social rent with 40% market rent, when it is nothing of the kind (link) - it is not determined by the market and in cash terms is equivalent to about 25-30% market rents in Southwark

£15-£20pw may not sound like too much to many people, but the Ledbury case demonstrates that is a significant mount to those who rely on council housing and may make the difference between having a home you can afford, or not.  Ledbury's demand (link) that their rents remain the same, should they move, have been soundly rebuffed by Southwark (link).


Well-founded suspicions, given the [Southwark's track record](http://35percent.org/the-southwark-clearances/) have wrested a promise that the estate will remain [100% council housing](https://www.ledburyestate.com/single-post/2017/11/14/Council-leaders-promise-once-again-to-keep-Ledbury-100-council).
