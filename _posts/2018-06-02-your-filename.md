## Ledbury estate

The beleagured tenants of the (Ledbury estate)[https://www.ledburyestate.com/] face stiff increases in housing costs, if they take-up an offer of new homes made by Southwark Council.  The homes are in Sylvan Court and the excellent (ledburyestate.com)[https://www.ledburyestate.com/blog] gives examples of 25% - 50% increases.

The council tax will be in a higher band, but the rent difference (of about £15-£20pw) is the consequence of a little noticed change in the Council's rent-setting process, made back in 2014.  This retained so-called 'target rents'for council home relets and new builds, while abandoning it for general rent-setting purposes.  'Target rents' were introduced by the government in 2001/02 in a vain attempt to raise all raise council rents up to housing association levels, but abandoned in 2014 with only 55% of Southwark rents at 'target rent', according to (Inside Housing)[[https://www.insidehousing.co.uk/insight/insight/missing-the-target-36408].

The excellent (ledburyestate.com)[https://www.ledburyestate.com/blog] chronicles the struggles of the estate's residents since then, ably led by the Ledbury TRA and Ledbury Action Group.  One of their demands is that tenants should not not end up paying more rent or face increased housing costs.

Well-founded suspicions, given the (Southwark's track record)[http://35percent.org/the-southwark-clearances/] have wrested a promise that the estate will remain (100% council housing)[https://www.ledburyestate.com/single-post/2017/11/14/Council-leaders-promise-once-again-to-keep-Ledbury-100-council.]

While it has not Ledbury estate tenants have now found themselves caught out by a little noticed change in Southwark Council's rent setting policy, made back in 2015, and face the prospect of a stiff rent rise.  From 2001/2 to 2015 rent levels were set according to so-called 'target rent' for relet and new properties, after it had been abandoned as the means for setting council rents.  'Target rents'  rather than the standard rent

£15-£20pw may not sound like too much to many people, but the Ledbury case demonstrates that is a significnat amount to those who rely on counicl housing and may make the difference between having a home you can afford, or not.
