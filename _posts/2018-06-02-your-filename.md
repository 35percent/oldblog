## Ledbury estate

The beleagured tenants of the (Ledbury estate)[https://www.ledburyestate.com/] face stiff increases in rent and council tax,if they take up an offer of new homes made by Southwark Council.  New homes are needed after an (Arups report)[http://www.southwark.gov.uk/housing/safety-in-the-home/fire-safety-on-the-ledbury-estate?chapter=4] recommended strengthening the four tower blocks on the estate to bring them up to building standard, works which would in all liklihood require the residents to leave their homes[https://www.ledburyestate.com/single-post/2017/11/22/ARUP-engineers-report-on-Ledbury-published].  The report was in turn commissioned by Southwark after persistent complaints by residents were finally heeded.  The residents' struggles, ably led by the Ledbury TRA and Ledbury Action Group, are chronicled by excellent (LAG blog)[https://www.ledburyestate.com/blog].

The new homes are in Sylvan Court and (LAG)[https://www.ledburyestate.com/blog] gives examples of total housing cost increases of 25% - 50%.

The council tax will be in a higher band, but the rent difference (of about £15-£20pw) is the consequence of a little noticed change in the (Council's rent-setting process)[http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s50449/Report%20HRA%20Budget%202015-16%20Indicative.pdf], made back in 2014.  In that year the government ended its vain attempt to raise council rents to housing association levels, through so-called 'target rents', introduced in 2001/2.  According to (Inside Housing)[[https://www.insidehousing.co.uk/insight/insight/missing-the-target-36408] only 55% of Southwark rents were then at the higher target rent, and Southwark decided it would retained for relets and new builds, such as Sylvan Court.

Southwark had sound financial reasons for this; like all councils it was entering a new 'self-financing' regime and had made its financial projections on the basis of the higher income provided by target rents.  Nonetheless the burden would be borne by tenants and in acknowledgement of this, Southwark allowed some exemptions, one of which was for tenants on regeneration estates.  This seems to have been forgotten though; Ledbury demands that they pay no more than they pay now have been rebuffed (link).  Strictly speaking Ledbury may not be a regeneration estate, but if the residents are subject to the same kind of involuntary moves they should surely be given the same consideration as such tenants.

Southwark's Tenants Council was consulted about the keeping target rents for relets and saw the danger of a two-tier rent system, gradually ratcheting all rents up as tenants changed (Southwark estaimated that this would acheived after 20 years), and duly voted 14 to 3 against the change, but to no avail.  Unsurprisingly, there was no wider consultation.




  One of their demands is that tenants should not not end up paying more rent or face increased housing costs.
 
Southwark announced the purchase of the 80 new build homes of (Sylvan Grove)[https://www.ledburyestate.com/single-post/2017/11/14/3-month-delay-on-new-local-homes-causes-further-misery-for-Ledbury-residents] from Hyde Housing in August and after delays they finally became available in...
Well-founded suspicions, given the (Southwark's track record)[http://35percent.org/the-southwark-clearances/] have wrested a promise that the estate will remain (100% council housing)[https://www.ledburyestate.com/single-post/2017/11/14/Council-leaders-promise-once-again-to-keep-Ledbury-100-council.]


£15-£20pw may not sound like too much to many people, but the Ledbury case demonstrates that is a significnat amount to those who rely on counicl housing and may make the difference between having a home you can afford, or not.
