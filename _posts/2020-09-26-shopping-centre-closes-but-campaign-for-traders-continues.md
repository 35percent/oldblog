The closure of the Elephant and Castle shopping centre last Thursday was [marked by protest](https://twitter.com/UpTheElephant) impassioned speeches and [widespread media coverage](https://docdro.id/thWuAyH).  The centre closed after 55 years’ service to the local community and is now set to be demolished, to make way for a new retail, leisure and residential complex.  Shopping centre owner, Delancey, leads the development partnership behind the new scheme.

While the centre’s major stores had gradually left over the previous months, many of the independent businesses were trading up to the final day.  The closure also brought the end for the market which occupied the centre’s ‘moat’, which numbered around [60 stalls just under 2 years ago](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DwEQ6HqW0AEbC6W.jpg):large when Southwark’s planning committee first considered developer Delancey’s proposals for the centre’s redevelopment.
