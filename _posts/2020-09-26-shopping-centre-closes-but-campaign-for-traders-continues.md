The closure of the Elephant and Castle shopping centre last Thursday was [marked by protest](https://twitter.com/UpTheElephant) impassioned speeches and [widespread media coverage](https://docdro.id/thWuAyH).  The centre closed after 55 yearsâ€™ service to the local community and is now set to be demolished, to make way for a new retail, leisure and residential complex.  Shopping centre owner, Delancey, leads the development partnership behind the new scheme.
