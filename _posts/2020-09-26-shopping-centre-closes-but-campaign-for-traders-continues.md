The closure of the Elephant and Castle shopping centre last Thursday was [marked by protest](https://twitter.com/UpTheElephant) impassioned speeches and [widespread media coverage](https://docdro.id/thWuAyH).  The centre closed after 55 years’ service to the local community and is now set to be demolished, to make way for a new retail, leisure and residential complex.  Shopping centre owner, Delancey, leads the development partnership behind the new scheme.

While the centre’s major stores had gradually left over the previous months, many of the independent businesses were trading up to the final day.  The closure also brought the end for the market which occupied the centre’s ‘moat’, which numbered around [60 stalls just under 2 years ago](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DwEQ6HqW0AEbC6W.jpg) when Southwark’s planning committee first considered developer Delancey’s proposals for the centre’s redevelopment.

Local charity Latin Elephant has noted that there were [130 independent traders at the Elephant in January 2018](https://latinelephant.org/map/) Only 40 traders have been relocated to three sites – Castle Square, Perronet House and on Elephant Park – [‘leaving about 40 traders who have been trading at least since January 2019 (as per the s106 agreement) without alternative premises’](https://latinelephant.org/public-statement-on-traders-without-relocation/). A major aim now of the traders and their supporters is to secure space that could double the number of relocated traders, with a [proposal to the Mayor for new market stalls at the Elephant](http://35percent.org/2020-09-14-shopping-centre-traders-propose-new-stalls-for-the-elephant/).

## Up the Elephant solidarity

A large protest organised by the [Up the Elephant campaign](https://twitter.com/UpTheElephant_?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) (which includes the 35% Campaign) marked the centre’s closure and commemorated the people who had worked there, many from for black and ethnic minorities, and its role as a social hub for the Latin American community, in particular.  The campaign has long fought against the demolition and Delancey’s redevelopment plans and while they lamented the centre’s fate, speakers also noted the gains that the campaign had made - more social housing, affordable retail space as well as [new premises for displaced traders](http://35percent.org/2018-10-30-shopping-centre-legal-challenge/) along with transition and relocation funding.
