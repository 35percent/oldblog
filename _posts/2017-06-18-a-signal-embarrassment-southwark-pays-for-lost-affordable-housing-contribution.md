title: 'A Signal embarrassment - Southwark pays for ''no cost'' affordable housing  '
---
## Private developer's affordable housing lost for years 

As most people know private developments are supposed to provide a certain amount of affordable housing, called S106 contributions.  The Signal Building at the Elephant and Castle is one such development - twenty-two storeys, 38 residential units, with an [S106 contribution of eleven affordable homes](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?casereference=09/AP/1940&system=DC), __'at no cost to the council'__ [^1] all agreed when planning permission was granted in 2011.

But in an extraordinary turn of events, Southwark Council's Cabinet is to [agree to set aside over £500,000](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/mgIssueHistoryHome.aspx?IssueId=50013861&OptionNum=0&) to pay the current leaseholders of nine of these 'affordable' properties, after alleging that they were wrongfully put onto the free-market.  Southwark then intends then to return them for use as affordable housing.

Southwark has been [pursuing a High Court claim](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s69255/Report%20Acquisition%20of%20up%20to%209%20sub-Leasehold%20properties%20at%20the%20Signal%20Building%2089%20-%2093%20Newington%20Ca.pdf)  against numerous defendants, including developers, a housing association and leaseholders.  While the case is due to begin between 5 and 7 July, scheduled to last 15 days, Southwark has set the money aside to __'facilitate settlement'__ with the leaseholders.  Southwark's (court claim) gives open market values of between £650,000 and £795,000 for each of the properties.  If there should be no settlement Southwark is seeking damages of £1.98m.  Southwark has already reached a confidential settlement with [London District Housing Association](http://www.londondha.com/) (LDHA) and with __'entities'__ from the Trademade group, who were involved in the development and financing of the scheme.

This settlement follows a similiar one, again confidential, with LDHA and Trademark entities, known as Protected Growth Plan and PGP, after Southwark alleged that 25 more affordable homes on four other developents wrongly found their way on to the free market.  Two of the developments were the Jam Factory,Tower Bridge Rd, the others at South City Court,Peckham and Wanley Rd., Camberwell.  In it's [High Court claim](http://35percent.org/img/2016poc.pdf) Southwark alleged __'sham'__ documents were used for __'fraudulent'__ purposes.  As reported in the [Sunday Times](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/affordable-housing-pledges-swept-under-mat-s5r7trv6g) in April, LDHA and Trademark denied Southwark's claims and they have not been proven in court.  The eventual settlement returned 17 units to affordable housing, according to a quote from Southwark; an S106 agreement between Southwark and new affordable housing provider, [Heylo Housing](http://heylohousing.com/your-heylo-housing/) for 16 units at the Jam Factory was signed on 4 April 2017.  35% Campaign understands that no damages have been paid to Southwark, who have said there has been no loss to the publci purse.  We have no information on the status of the eight 'affordable' housing units at South City Court and Wanley Rd.

###Southwark's claim###

The essence of Southwark's allegations for all the sites was that the affordable housing, 
was improperly __'stair-cased out'__ ie passed into full ownership and thus onto the open market, in an implausibly short length of time.  The usual period is 21 years, acording to approved Homes and Communities Agency leases.  In the Signal House court papers Southwark allege that three of the properties were purportedly __'stair-cased  out'__ in 2 days, two in 3 days, one in 4 days and another in 7 days [^2].  [The Sunday Times](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/affordable-housing-pledges-swept-under-mat-s5r7trv6g) reports that LDHA denied executing or knowing about any sham documentation.  Property Growth Plan are reported as saying they were not party to the original S1O6 agreements, was not bound by them and had not breached any law.

###Neobrand limited, Neobrand No 2###

The [named developer](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!dmSwvsIphYtbdUvdn3A09Q%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) of the Signal Building is Neobrand Limited, who a web search reveals to be [an estate agents in ](http://www.192.com/atoz/business/london-n20/estate-agents/neobrand-limited/96e72f73ac06593e62ed2e5afa6bcb30f07ca4f0/comp/)
