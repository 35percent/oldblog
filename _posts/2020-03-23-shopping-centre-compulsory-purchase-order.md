title: Council seeks CPO powers and to 'buy' E&C shopping centre and LCC
subtitle: Council to approve compulsory purchase of shopping centre traders

In an extraordinary move Southwark Council is poised to 'buy' both the Elephant and Castle shopping centre and the London College of Communication from current owners, developer Delancey and and the University of the Arts London (UAL).  It is also ready to assume Compulsory Purchase Order (CPO) powers over the redevelopment site, on behalf of Delancey. [^1]  

The purchase of the shopping centre and LCC land is part of a legal manoeuvre, vesting ownership in a public body, that will overide the rights of those whose light will be effected by the redevelopment of the two sites.  A leasing arrangement will allow both sites to return to Delancey and UAL control. [^2]    

The CPO powers are needed because Delancey has yet to secure full control of the whole development site and is still in negotiations with a long list of the so-called [third-party 'interests'](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s88166/Appendix%20C.pdf) (traders, UAL, Transport for London, London Underground Limited, Network Rail and the Arches Company). Southwark will buy-out those who have these interests (eg a lease), at Delancey's request, if no agreement can be reached with them.  The CPO threat will undoubtedly also strengthen Delancey's negotiating hand. [^3] 

Southwark say that both measures can be done at no cost to itself, with Delancey ultimately meeting all costs, but no figures are provided in the [three publicly available reports](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=302&MId=6420&Ver=4), detailing the arrangements. Decisions on both measures will be made at a video-call Cabinet meeting [next Tuesday, 24 March](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=302&MId=6420&Ver=4).

## Will the scheme ever happen?

The main justification for the proposed measures is to ensure the success of the development.  Council officers advise that if they are not adopted Delancey may meet delays and will not secure the _'enormous funding'_ the scheme requires and then the site could lie empty for years.

Despite this worry officers are nonetheless sure enough that the development will go ahead not to require any guarantee from Delancey that they will proceed with the scheme, even if Southwark does Delancey's will, by execising CPO powers and interferring with third-party rights to light.  [The CPO report](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s88163/Report%20EC%20CPO.pdf) says _'it is not necessary to impose... an obligation to build the Scheme as the measures negotiated for inclusion in the indemnity agreement give the Council comfort that EC is likely to proceed with the Scheme.'_ [^4]

The contrast between Southwark's complacent treatment of Delancey, (a property developer rooted in off-shore shell companies) and the neglectful manner traders who have made the Elephant their home, are treated is also laid bare.  Under CPO legislation Southwark is required _'to exercise its power...in a manner which, so far as practicable, secures that relevant occupiers of that land are provided with a suitable opportunity to obtain accommodation on the land in question.'_ [^5]  

This has never happened; such [relocation benefits](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/regeneration/elephant-and-castle?chapter=20) as there are (eg the [£634,700 relocation fund](https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/developer-delancey-submits-plans-for-castle-square-temporary-home-for-elephant-traders/), the [£200k New Home Bonus Fund](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s88157/Report%20EC%20Shopping%20Centre%20Progress.pdf)) have been won by the traders and local campaigners and owe little to Southwark Council's efforts. Even with these gains, at 60 traders [still have no new premises](http://35percent.org/2020-01-20-elephant-traders-still-homeless/) and those who do will be re-housed off-site, with only some (those in [Castle Square](https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/developer-delancey-submits-plans-for-castle-square-temporary-home-for-elephant-traders/)) having the smallest possibility of _'accommodation of the land in question'_.

## Southwark has always had the power

By Southwark's own account the scheme may well not go forward unless it adopts CPO powers, because Delancey is unwilling to bear the risk of the uncertainty created by its abscence, given its _'enormous capital investment in the Scheme'_ and in addition _'any prudent funder of the Scheme is also unlikely to fund the Scheme whilst that uncertainty persists'_. [^6]

Southwark therefore has had a great deal of legitimate leverage.  It was clear when Delancey first submitted [its planning application](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications-old/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=externalDocuments&keyVal=_STHWR_DCAPR_9569810) for the shopping centre's redevelopment, back in 2016, that there was little intention of retaining resident traders in the new redevelopment.  When Delancey descibed the traders as _'benefiting from disproportionately low levels of rent'_ and unlikely _'to survive....over the longer term'_. [^7] Southwark should have made it clear then that [any anticipated use of CPO powers](http://35percent.org/2015-11-04-southwark-resolves-to-use-cpo-powers-for-shopping-centre-retailers/) would be dependant on fufilling the requirement that _'relevant occupiers'_ ie the traders were given the opportunity to stay in the new development.

As it is, it looks as if Southwark intends to sacrifice trader's interests, again, in favour of Delancey, just as it sacrificed those who depend on social rented housing, when it [granted Delancey planning permission](http://35percent.org/2018-07-09-delancey/), without securing the minimum amount required by its own policies.

## The coronavirus risk

According to [the CPO report](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s88163/Report%20EC%20CPO.pdf), Southwark intends to indemnify itself against any mishaps in its CPO arrangements with Delancey, including, amongst other things, a requirement that there be a _'reasonable prospect of the development of that area being delivered in a reasonable time frame'_ [^8].

Any sensible person, or local authority, must now see that this is unlikely, given the coronavirus crisis and it multi-dimensional impact.  Southwark should at the very least defer consideration of taking up CPO powers and the purchase of the shopping centre and the LCC sites, on any terms. At the same time it should use its resources to maintain and improve support of the traders and insist that Delancey do the same, if it wishes to have the benefit of CPO powers at some time on the future.

## New tube station entr
The CPO report lauds the public benefits of the scheme like the new tube station entrance but fails to say that Southwark Council is paying the lion's share of this - [(£70m)]()http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s86588/Report%20Elephant%20and%20Castle%20Bakerloo%20Line%20Extension.pdf.


[^1]: According to Southwark, Delancey is not the developer, but rather the advisor to the so-called 'Triangle Partnership', which is the Dutch pension fund APG; QDHK Holdngs Ltd Partnership and Door SLP. There are further partnerships within this Triangle, detailed in the [Report: E&C CPO](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s88163/Report%20EC%20CPO.pdf) para 12.  Southwark refer to the developer as Elephant & Castle Properties Co. Limited ("EC").  We continue to refer to the developer by the commonly known name of 'Delancey'.
