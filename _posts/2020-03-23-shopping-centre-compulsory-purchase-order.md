Southwark Council is poised to 'buy' the sites of the Elephant and Castle shopping centre redevelopment from current owners, developer Delancey and and the London College of Communication (LCC) respectively.  It is also ready to assume Compulsory Purchase Order (CPO) powers over the redevelopment site, on behalf of Delancey[^1].  Decisions on both measures will be made at a Cabinet meeting next Tuesday, 24 March.

The purchase of the shopping centre and LCC is part of a legal maneuvre that will overide the legal rights of those whose light will be effected by the redevelopment of the two sites. A leasing arrangement will allow both sites to return to Delancey and UAL control.    

The CPO powers require Southwark to buy out any traders or others who have an interest in the shopping centre, at Delancey's request, if no agreement can be reached with them, Delancey to reimburse the cost.  It is also designed to strengthen Delancey's negotiating hand can take control over all the land, within the developement site.

Southwark say that both measures can be done at no cost to itself, with Delancey ultimately meeting all costs, but no figures are provided in the three publicly available reports, detailing the arrangements.

The CPO is needed because Delancey has yet to secure full control of the whole development site and is still in negotiations with a long list of the so-called third-party 'interests' which include traders, UAL, Transport for London, London Underground Limited, Network Rail and the Arches Company, 

It intends to do this by way of a leasing arrangement Southwark will also take on Compulsory Purchase Order powers to ensure that Delancey can take over all the land  within the development site  of compulsory control powers over the Elephantand Castle shopping centre 




Last week the BBC [ran a feature](https://twitter.com/LatinElephant/status/1239870649851613185) on the last remaining traders at Elephant & Castle shopping centre.

Buried in this week's Council papers is the news that the Council is purchasing the shopping centre from developer Delancey in order to remove the last remaining traders. 

## Delancey is not the developer!
The developer is in fact a shell company registered in the British Virgin Islands. Delancey is just 'advising' the shell company..

## New tube station entr
The CPO report lauds the public benefits of the scheme like the new tube station entrance but fails to say that Southwark Council is paying the lion's share of this - [(Â£70m)]()http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s86588/Report%20Elephant%20and%20Castle%20Bakerloo%20Line%20Extension.pdf.
[^1]: Delancy is not strictly speaking the developer, according to Southwark, rather just the advisor to the so-called 'Triangle Partnership'.  The complicated partnership arrangements   - Dutch Pension fund APG, QDHK Holdngs Ltd Parnership, (Quatar Sovereign Wealth Fund), Door SLP  - are detailed in the report para 12.  We will continue to refer to Delancey as the developer, being the active, publicly visible party.
