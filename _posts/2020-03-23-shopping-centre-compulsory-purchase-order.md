title: Council seeks CPO powers and to 'buy' E&C shopping centre and UAL building
subtitle: Council to approve compulsory purchase of shopping centre traders

In an extraordinary move Southwark Council is poised to 'buy' both the Elephant and Castle shopping centre and the London College of Communication from current owners, developer Delancey and and the University of the Arts London (UAL).  It is also ready to assume Compulsory Purchase Order (CPO) powers over the redevelopment site, on behalf of Delancey[^1].  

The purchase of the shopping centre and LCC is part of a legal manouvre that will overide the rights of those whose light will be effected by the redevelopment of the two sites. A leasing arrangement will allow both sites to return to Delancey and UAL control.    

The CPO powers are needed because Delancey has yet to secure full control of the whole development site and is still in negotiations with a long list of the so-called third-party 'interests'(traders, UAL, Transport for London, London Underground Limited, Network Rail and the Arches Company). Southwark will buy-out any traders or others who have an interest (eg a lease) in the shopping centre, at Delancey's request, if no agreement can be reached with them.  The CPO threat is also designed to strengthen Delancey's negotiating hand.

Southwark say that both measures can be done at no cost to itself, with Delancey ultimately meeting all costs, but no figures are provided in the three publicly available reports, detailing the arrangements. Decisions on both measures will be made at a Cabinet meeting next Tuesday, 24 March.

## Will the scheme ever happen?

The main justification for the measures is to ensure the success of the development.  Council officers advise that if they are not adopted Delancey may meet delays and will not secure the _'enormous funding'_ the scheme requires and then the site could lie empty for years.

Despite this worry officers are nonetheless sure enough that the development will go ahead not to require any guarantee from Delancey that they will proceed with the scheme, even if Southwark does Delancey's will, by execising CPO powers and interferring with third-party rights to light.  The CPO report says _it is not
necessary to impose... an obligation to build the Scheme as the measures negotiated for inclusion in the indemnity agreement give the Council comfort that EC is likely to proceed with the Scheme._ 




Last week the BBC [ran a feature](https://twitter.com/LatinElephant/status/1239870649851613185) on the last remaining traders at Elephant & Castle shopping centre.

Buried in this week's Council papers is the news that the Council is purchasing the shopping centre from developer Delancey in order to remove the last remaining traders. 

## Delancey is not the developer!
The developer is in fact a shell company registered in the British Virgin Islands. Delancey is just 'advising' the shell company..

## New tube station entr
The CPO report lauds the public benefits of the scheme like the new tube station entrance but fails to say that Southwark Council is paying the lion's share of this - [(Â£70m)]()http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s86588/Report%20Elephant%20and%20Castle%20Bakerloo%20Line%20Extension.pdf.
[^1]: Delancy is not strictly speaking the developer, according to Southwark, rather just the advisor to the so-called 'Triangle Partnership'.  The complicated partnership arrangements   - Dutch Pension fund APG, QDHK Holdngs Ltd Parnership, (Quatar Sovereign Wealth Fund), Door SLP  - are detailed in the report para 12.  We will continue to refer to Delancey as the developer, being the active, publicly visible party.
