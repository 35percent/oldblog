title: Council seeks CPO powers and to 'buy' E&C shopping centre and LCC
subtitle: Council to approve compulsory purchase of shopping centre traders

In an extraordinary move Southwark Council is poised to 'buy' both the Elephant and Castle shopping centre and the London College of Communication from current owners, developer Delancey and and the University of the Arts London (UAL).  It is also ready to assume Compulsory Purchase Order (CPO) powers over the redevelopment site, on behalf of Delancey[^1].  

The purchase of the shopping centre and LCC is part of a legal manoeuvre, vesting ownership in a public body, [^2] that will overide the rights of those whose light will be effected by the redevelopment of the two sites. A leasing arrangement will allow both sites to return to Delancey and UAL control.    

The CPO powers are needed because Delancey has yet to secure full control of the whole development site and is still in negotiations with a long list of the so-called third-party 'interests' (traders, UAL, Transport for London, London Underground Limited, Network Rail and the Arches Company). Southwark will buy-out those who have these interests (eg a lease), at Delancey's request, if no agreement can be reached with them.  The CPO threat is also designed to strengthen Delancey's negotiating hand.

Southwark say that both measures can be done at no cost to itself, with Delancey ultimately meeting all costs, but no figures are provided in the three publicly available reports, detailing the arrangements. Decisions on both measures will be made at a video-call Cabinet meeting next Tuesday, 24 March.

## Will the scheme ever happen?

The main justification for the proposed measures is to ensure the success of the development.  Council officers advise that if they are not adopted Delancey may meet delays and will not secure the _'enormous funding'_ the scheme requires and then the site could lie empty for years.

Despite this worry officers are nonetheless sure enough that the development will go ahead not to require any guarantee from Delancey that they will proceed with the scheme, even if Southwark does Delancey's will, by execising CPO powers and interferring with third-party rights to light.  The CPO report complacently says '_it is not necessary to impose... an obligation to build the Scheme as the measures negotiated for inclusion in the indemnity agreement give the Council comfort that EC is likely to proceed with the Scheme._'

The contrast between Southwark's benign treatment of Delancey, (a property developer rooted in off-shore shell companies) and the neglectful manner traders who have made the Elephant their home, are treated is also laid bare.  Under CPO legislation Southwark is required _'to exercise its power...in a manner which, so far as practicable, secures that relevant occupiers of that land are provided with a suitable opportunity to obtain accommodation on the land in question'_.  This has never happened;such relocation benefits as there are (eg Castle Square, the relocation fund) have been won by the traders and local campaigners and owe little to Southwark Council's efforts. As it is at least half the traders still have no new premises and those who do will be re-housed off-site, with only some (those in Castle Square) having the smallest posssibility of _'accommodation of the land in question'_.

## Southwark has always had the power

By Southwark's own account the scheme may well not go forward without CPO powers, because Delancey is unwilling to bear the risk of the uncertainty created by its abscence, given its _'enormous capital investment in the Scheme'_ and in addition _'any prudent funder of the Scheme is also unlikely to fund the Scheme whilst that uncertainty persists'_ (Item 24, para 57).

Southwark therefore has had a great deal of legitimate leverage.  It was clear from the very start that Delancey had little intention of retaining anymore than the minimum of resident traders, describing them as 'benefiting from disproportionately low levels of rent' and unlikely 'to survive....over the longer term' (Planning Statement 8.7). Southwark should have been equally clear that any anticipated use of CPO powers would be dependant on fufilling the requirement that 'relevant occupiers' ie the traders were given the opportunity to stay in the new development.

As it is it looks as if Southwark intends to sacrifice trader's interests, in favour of Delancey, just as it sacrificed those of the many who depend on an affordable housing,when it granted Delancey planning permission, without securing the minimum amount of social rented housing.

## The coronavirus risk

According to the reports, Southwark intends to indemnify itself against any mishaps in its CPO arrangements with Delancey, including, amongst other things, a requirement that there be a reasonable prospect of development going ahead in a reasonable timefrome'.  Any sensible person, or local authority, must now see that this is unlikely, given the coronavirus crisis and it multi-dimensional impact.  Southwark should at the very least defer consideration of taking further CPO powers and any purchase of the shopping centre and UAL, on any terms. At the same time it should use its resources to maintain and improve support of the traders and inssiting Delancey do the same, if it wishes to have the benefit of CPO powers at some time on the future.


Last week the BBC [ran a feature](https://twitter.com/LatinElephant/status/1239870649851613185) on the last remaining traders at Elephant & Castle shopping centre.

Buried in this week's Council papers is the news that the Council is purchasing the shopping centre from developer Delancey in order to remove the last remaining traders. 

## Delancey is not the developer!
The developer is in fact a shell company registered in the British Virgin Islands. Delancey is just 'advising' the shell company..

## New tube station entr
The CPO report lauds the public benefits of the scheme like the new tube station entrance but fails to say that Southwark Council is paying the lion's share of this - [(Â£70m)]()http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s86588/Report%20Elephant%20and%20Castle%20Bakerloo%20Line%20Extension.pdf.


[^1]: According to Southwark, Delancey is not strictly speaking the developer, but rather the advisor to the so-called 'Triangle Partnership', which is the Dutch pension fund APG; QDHK Holdngs Ltd Partnership and Door SLP. There are further partnerships within this Triangle, detailed in the [Report: E&C CPO](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s88163/Report%20EC%20CPO.pdf) para 12.  We will continue to refer to Delancey as the developer, being the active, publicly visible party.
