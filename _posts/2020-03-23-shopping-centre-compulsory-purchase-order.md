Southwark Council is poised to 'buy' the sites of the Elephant and Castle shopping centre redevelopment from current owners, developer Delancey and and the London College of Communication (LCC) respectively.  It is also ready to assume Compulsory Purchase Order (CPO) powers over the redevelopment site, on behalf of Delancey[^1].  The purchase of the shopping centre and LCC is part of a legal maneuvre that will overide the legal rights of those whose light will be effected by the redevelopment of the two sites.  The CPO powers  will strenthen Delancey's negotiating hand with those who still have leases or other interests at the shopping centre and to ensure that Delancey can take control over all the land, within the developement site.
