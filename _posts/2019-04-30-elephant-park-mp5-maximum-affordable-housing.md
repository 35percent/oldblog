Last and final phase of Elephant Park has been submitted and the [planning documents](http://35percent.org/img/epupdatedahstrategy.pdf) show that of the 424 homes proposed in this phase (220 more than were originally approved), just 15 will be social rent.

The officer's report for the outline planning application said that there was no grant funding available but that should it become available then there would be a revised affordable housing offer.

## Community Space
Lendlease was required to build 1,000sqm of community space - this has been provided in the new 'energy centre' as a private creche.
Meanwhile, Southwark has had to purchase 600sqm of retail space from Lendlease (for Â£6m) to use as a library.
