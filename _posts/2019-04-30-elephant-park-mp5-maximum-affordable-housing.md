## Only 15 social rent on final MP5 phase

The [detailed planning application](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=externalDocuments&keyVal=_STHWR_DCAPR_9582742) for in the last residential plot in the redeveloped Heygate estate has been submitted to Southwark Council by developer Lendlease.

Lendlease proposes building 424 new homes on the MP5 H7 plot, with 72 affordable units, made up of 37 shared-ownership, 20 affordable rent and 15 social rent.

This will take the total number of social rented units in the development to just 92, a figure that has crept up from [71 units](http://35percent.org/2013-01-13-will-the-planning-committee-see-sense/) since 2013 (plus a further [eight on Trafalgar Place](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!DcDunvLF2MOAcCag9FShbg%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) (Heygate Phase 1)).

## 220 more homes than agreed, but 29 fewer affordable.

The application also shows that the completed development, now known as Elephant Park, is set to deliver more homes in total than were approved by Southwark's planning committee, but with 29 fewer affordable homes than anticipated.

Lendlease _'anticipates'_ that the completed development, now known as Elephant Park, will total 2,689 homes.  This is 220 more homes than the numbers agreed by the planning committee in January 2013, which approved a development of between 2,300 and 2,469 homes.

Only 541 of these homes will be affordable, twenty-nine fewer than the indicative figure of 570 given to the same planning committee, for a development of the maximum approved size.  The affordable housing is broken down into 92 social rented, 167 affordable rent and 282 shared ownership.

The figures for the total and affordable units are given in planning documents for MP5, the final phase of the development - Table 7 of the [Reserved Matters Affordable Housing Strategy](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!Mz5nzvZX38X%2fWRNbT2Vd6A%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) and Table 8.1 of the [Reconciliation Statement](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!ODWxL4QoZvkgXXbACxb5vg%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) for the [Elephant Park - MP5 H7 Reserved Matters Application](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=externalDocuments&keyVal=_STHWR_DCAPR_9582742).  The figure for the 570 approved affordable homes was given on page 9 of the planning committee's [addendum report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!Q7K%2bVQ5GwV3kVWHHRXBCqg%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d)   (correcting a previous figure of [574](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!swSywGCW3zgzV1miHXgXSg%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d)).

## Southwark fail to secure housing numbers

  The increase from 2,469 to 2,689 total units on Elephant Park  has been facilitated by an [amendment](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=externalDocuments&keyVal=_STHWR_DCAPR_9580199) to the original planning permission.  This was made in November 2018 and changed the way the amount of residential space was calculated by [replacing the minimum and maximum figures for residential units](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!s8fyBoziHiy%2fr1TPdwL8eQ%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) with floorspace figures. The floorspace figures remained the same as those [approved by the planning committee](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!hgyBVuEH%2b8BxXry2bGRAtA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d)   (160,579sqm GEA {min} and 254,400sqm GEA {max}), but by removing the unit figures the amendment enables Lendlease to build more homes within the allowed floorspace.

It also transpires that the [number of units to be built were not secured](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!RmPsohICrz2DqmiiC%2fGX%2fQ%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) in the original planning permission, thus opening the door to the amendment, which was deemed 'non-material' and so was approved by officers and not referred back to the planning committee.

## Policy compliance

While Lendlease has not delivered the number of affordable homes expected by the planning committee, they are nonetheless able to say they are [fulfilling the affordable housing obligation of 25% affordable housing](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!ODWxL4QoZvkgXXbACxb5vg%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d).  This is because the amount of affordable housing is measured as a percentage of habitable rooms, not units. The [officers report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!swSywGCW3zgzV1miHXgXSg%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) to the planning committee noted that there were a relatively high proportion of larger affordable units.
These are undoubtedly welcome, but do mean that there is just 20% affordable housing when measured by units. 

## Viability questions

Officers at the time of the application's determination proposed only an early viability review, in the limited circumstances that the development was delayed and no new viability assessment has been presented to take into account the increased number of total units or the fewer affordable units that will actually be delivered.

![](http://35percent.org/img/vrev.png)

The increase in maxiumum units to 2,689 units with the 29 unit drop in affordable housing gives Lendlease about 190 more free-market homes than the planning committee was led to believe would be built.  These have a rough estimated value of £80m, a figure that obviously cannot have featured in the 2012 [viability assessment](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/HeygateViabilityAssessment_MainReport.pdf).  This assessment was made on the basis of 2,462 units and concluded that the scheme could not provide 35% affordable housing and that only a very small fraction could be social rented.


## No public funding?

The lack of available public funding was cited in the [officer's report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!swSywGCW3zgzV1miHXgXSg%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) as a factor that diminished the chances of a viable scheme delivering 35% affordable housing, when the application was originally considered.

This came with the reassurance that should public funding become available, it could be used to improve the affordable housing position.  There is no indication that this has happened through the duration of Elephant Park's development, despite the [Mayor Sadiq Khan having £4.6bn in his kitty](https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/housing-and-land/homes-londoners-affordable-homes-programme-2016-21).

## Object to MP5 - fight for 84 more affordable homes

Lendlease's detailed MP5 H7 application is almost the final chapter in the [redevelopment of the Heygate estate](http://35percent.org/heygate-regeneration-faq/) and it allows us to evaluate what is being delivered, against what was said and what was approved by Southwark Council, back in 2013.

It is now apparent that while Lendlease will fulfill its reduced affordable housing obligation they intend to do so by delivering fewer affordable homes. Lendlease has also been granted a change in the permission that has allowed them to build many more units.  The upshot is that Lendlease has about 190 more free-market homes to sell.

Southwark, on the other hand, neglected to secure the number of homes to be built and gave Lendlease the opportunity to build more, without getting any improvement in the affordable housing situation. There also appears to have been no effort to take advantage of any public funding. 

This final Heygate application must be decided by the planning committee, not officers alone.  It must ask why we are getting fewer affordable housing units than it was told to expect, while Lendlease were allowed to build more units in total.  The committee must also ask why there have been no viablity assessments or reviews since 2013 and what has been done to improve the affordable housing.

The planning committee must refuse planning permission, unless Lendlease increases the total number of affordable homes, back to the indicative 570 the planning committee approved, plus 25% of the additional 220 units it has gained over the original maximum build.  This would give us a much-needed 84 affordable homes and half of these must be social rented, as Southwark's housing policy requires.
