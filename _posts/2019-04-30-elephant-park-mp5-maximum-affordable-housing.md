title: Heyate redevelopment fails to deliver promised affordable housing

## 220 more homes than agreed, but 29 fewer affordable.

The completion of the Heygate redevelopment is set to deliver more homes than were approved by Southwark's planning committee, but there will be 29 fewer affordable homes than anticipated.

Developer Lendlease _'anticipates'_ that the completed development, now known as Elephant Park, will total 2,689 homes.  This is 220 more homes than the numbers agreed at the planning committee in November 2013, when permission was given for between 2,300 and 2,469 homes.

Despite this increase in the total number, only 541 of these homes will be affordable; 570 was the indicative affordable housing figure given to the planning committee for a maximum build-out.  The affordable housing is broken down into 92 social rented, 167 affordable rent and 282 shared ownership.

The 'anticipated' figures for the total and affordable units are given in planning documents for MP5, the final phase of the development - Table 7 of the [Reserved Matters Affordable Housing Strategy](http://35percent.org/img/epupdatedahstrategy.pdf) and Table 8.1 of the [Reconciliation Statement](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!ODWxL4QoZvkgXXbACxb5vg%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) for the [Elephant Park - MP5 H7 Reserved Matters Application](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=externalDocuments&keyVal=_STHWR_DCAPR_9582742).  The figure for the 570 approved affordable homes was given on page 9 of the planning committee's [addendum report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!Q7K%2bVQ5GwV3kVWHHRXBCqg%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d), (which corrected a previous figure of [574](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!swSywGCW3zgzV1miHXgXSg%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d)).  The addendum report said that 570 affordable homes would be delivered if the maximum number of new homes were built (screen shot).

## MP5 - 15 social rent

The proposed total units for MP5 will be on the final residential plot, H7, and is for 424 new homes, with 352 private and 72 affordable units - 20 affordable rent, 37 shared-ownership and 15 social rent.

This will take the total number of social rented units in the development to 92, a figure that has crept up from [71 units](http://35percent.org/2013-01-13-will-the-planning-committee-see-sense/) since 2013 (plus a further [eight on Trafalgar Place](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!DcDunvLF2MOAcCag9FShbg%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) (Heygate Phase 1)).

## How planning works

The increase in the total number of units has been facilitated by an [amendment](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=externalDocuments&keyVal=_STHWR_DCAPR_9580199) tot the original planning permission made back in Nov 201.  This changed the way the amount of residential space was calculated by [replacing the minimum and maximum figures for residential units](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!s8fyBoziHiy%2fr1TPdwL8eQ%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) with floorspace figures. The floorspace figures remained the same as those [approved by the planning committee](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!hgyBVuEH%2b8BxXry2bGRAtA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d)   (para 81- 160,579sqm GEA (min) and 254,400sqm GEA (max)), but by removing the unit figures the amendment enabled Lendlease to build more homes within the allowed floorspace.

This significant change was deemed 'non-material' (explain) and so was not referred back to the planning committee, but approved by officers. It also transpires that the [number of units to be built were not secured](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!RmPsohICrz2DqmiiC%2fGX%2fQ%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) in the original planning permission (screenshot), thus opening the door to the change using floorspace, rather than unit, figures.

## Policy compliance

While Lendlease has not delivered the number of affordable homes approved by the planning committee, it is nonetheless able to say it is [fulfilling the affordable housing obligation of 25% affordable housing](http://35percent.org/img/epupdatedahstrategy.pdf).  This is because the the amount of affordable housing is measured as a percentage of what is built, measured by habitable rooms (footnote - Table 8).  The larger affordable housing rented homes are undoubtedly welcome, but do mean that there is just 20% affordable housing when measured by unit. 


## Overage

## Conclusion

When we add the increase of free market homes to the reduction in affordable homes we can see that Lendlease has gained 249 more freemarket homes than the planning committee was led to believe would be built. This has been achieved by clever variation of the original approval that allow the scheme to remain 'compliant' and without any referral back to the planning committee. At a rough estimate, the value of these homes is £125m, a figure that obviously cannot have featured in the 2012 [viability assessment](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/HeygateViabilityAssessment_MainReport.pdf).  This was conducted on the basis of 2,462 units, not 2,689, (screenshot) and determined that the scheme could not provide a policy compliant 35% affordable housing and that only a very small fraction of this could be social rented.  No new viability assessment taking this into account was submitted when Lendlease applied to [change how the amount of affordable housing was calculated](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?casereference=18/AP/3225&system=DC).

## Object to MP5

The application for MP5 has yet to be approved, but without objections will not go to planning committee.  This is an application which must be decided by the planning committee.  It must ask why we are getting fewer affordable housing units than promised, while Lendlease are building more units in total.  It must also ask why there have been no viablity assessements or reviews since 2012have been c

## Heygate estate - the endgame

the submission of detailed planning application for (one of the plots) in the last phase of Elephant Park has been [submitted](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?casereference=19/AP/1166&system=DC) and the [planning documents](http://35percent.org/img/epupdatedahstrategy.pdf) show that of the 424 homes proposed in this phase (220 more than were originally approved), just 15 will be social rent.

MP5 fifth and final phase. It has two plots H1 and H7; application is being made to develope H7 with 424 units.  This is all the units for MP5 (Reserved matters affordable housing statement 19/AP/0025, Table 7); what's happening to H1?

The officer's report for the outline planning application said that there was currently no grant funding available and that this is one of the reasons why the affordable housing offer is not compliant.

But it did say that that should it become available then there would be a revised affordable housing offer.

## Viability Review
The planning committee report also said that there would be viability reviews:

## Community Space
 Lendlease was required to build 1,000sqm of community space - this has been provided in the new 'energy centre' as a private creche.
Meanwhile, Southwark has had to purchase 600sqm of retail space from Lendlease (for £6m) to use as a library.

## Affordable retail strategy

Any opportunity for shopping centre traders to object?



 ( an increase of 220 more homes, over the maxiumum approved by the planning committee, 389 over the minimum approved.  When measured against the estimated amounts of affordable housing for the minimum approved 2300 homes  (including an estimated 19 more social rented units, but 27 fewer affordable rent at 50% market rent)
 
MP7's new homes will include 102 affordable units,

 But though this may explains the difference in percentage terms, it does not explain why the number of units is less than the planning committee expected.  The [officers report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!swSywGCW3zgzV1miHXgXSg%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d)) to the committee was aware that larger units meant a lower number would be affordable, but still gave a figure of 570

the number of units can be below 25% this was taken into account (OR para 166).
