title: Heyate redevelopment fails to deliver promised affordable housing

## 220 more homes than agreed, but 29 fewer affordable.

The completion of the Heygate redevelopment is set to deliver more homes than were approved by Southwark's planning committee, but there will be 29 fewer affordable homes than promised.

Developer Lendlease 'anticipates' that the completed development, now known as Elephant Park, will total 2,689 homes.  This is 220 more homes than the numbers agreed at the planning committee in November 2013, when permission was given for between 2,300 and 2,469 homes.

Despite this increase in the total number, only 541 of these homes will be affordable.  The affordable housing is broken down into 92 social rented, 167 affordable rent and 282 shared ownership.

The 'anticipated' figures for the total and affordable units are given in Table 7 of a [Reserved Matters Affordable Housing Strategy](http://35percent.org/img/epupdatedahstrategy.pdf) for the [Elephant Park - MP5 H7 Reserved Matters Application](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=externalDocuments&keyVal=_STHWR_DCAPR_9582742).  The figure for the 570 approved affordable homes was given on page 9 of the planning committee's [addendum report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!Q7K%2bVQ5GwV3kVWHHRXBCqg%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d), (which corrected a previous figure of [574](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!swSywGCW3zgzV1miHXgXSg%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d)).  The addendum report said that 570 affordable homes would be delivered if the maximum number of new homes were built (screen shot).

The proposed total units for MP5 will be on the final residential plot, H7, and is for 424 new homes, with 352 private, with 72 affordable units - 20 affordable rent, 15 social rent, 37 shared-ownership - and 11 more (?) affordable wheelchair units.


## How planning works


An [amendment](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=externalDocuments&keyVal=_STHWR_DCAPR_9580199) made back in Nov 2018 facilitated the increase in the total number of homes.  This changed the way the amount of residential space was calculated by [replacing the minimum and maximum figures for residential units](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!s8fyBoziHiy%2fr1TPdwL8eQ%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) with floorspace figures. The floorspace figures remained the same as those [approved by the planning committee](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!hgyBVuEH%2b8BxXry2bGRAtA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d)   (para 81- 160,579sqm GEA (min) and 254,400sqm GEA (max)), but by removing the unit figures the amendment enabled Lendlease to build more homes within the allowed floorspace.

This significant change was deemed 'non-material' (explain) and so was not referred back to the planning committee, but approved by officers.

Notwithstanding Lendlease's failure to deliver the number of affordable homes approved by the planning, it is nonetheless able to say it is meeting the planning approval requirement of 25% affordable housing, half rented, half shared-ownership.  This is because the the amount of affordable housing is measured by habitable room, not units and there is a relatively greater number of larger affordable housing rented units (OR para 166). On this basis Lendlease is able to [claim it is delivering 25.8% affordable housing](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?casereference=19/AP/1166&system=DC), in almost the correct proportions, between rent and shared ownership (footnote - Table 8).

## Heygate estate - the endgame

the submission of detailed planning application for (one of the plots) in the last phase of Elephant Park has been [submitted](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?casereference=19/AP/1166&system=DC) and the [planning documents](http://35percent.org/img/epupdatedahstrategy.pdf) show that of the 424 homes proposed in this phase (220 more than were originally approved), just 15 will be social rent.

MP5 fifth and final phase. It has two plots H1 and H7; application is being made to develope H7 with 424 units.  This is all the units for MP5 (Reserved matters affordable housing statement 19/AP/0025, Table 7); what's happening to H1?

The officer's report for the outline planning application said that there was currently no grant funding available and that this is one of the reasons why the affordable housing offer is not compliant.

But it did say that that should it become available then there would be a revised affordable housing offer.

## Viability Review
The planning committee report also said that there would be viability reviews:

## Community Space
 Lendlease was required to build 1,000sqm of community space - this has been provided in the new 'energy centre' as a private creche.
Meanwhile, Southwark has had to purchase 600sqm of retail space from Lendlease (for Â£6m) to use as a library.
