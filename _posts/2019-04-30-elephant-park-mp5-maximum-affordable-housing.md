## 220 more homes than agreed, but 29 fewer affordable.

The [detailed planning application]((http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?casereference=19/AP/1166&system=DC)) for in the last residential plot in redeveloped Heygate estate has been submitted to Southwark Council by developer Lendlease.  The application shows that the completed development, now known as Elephant Park, is set to deliver more homes than were approved by Southwark's planning committee, but with 29 fewer affordable homes than anticipated.

Developer Lendlease _'anticipates'_ that the completed development, now known as Elephant Park, will total 2,689 homes.  This is 220 more homes than the numbers agreed at the planning committee in November 2013, when permission was given for between 2,300 and 2,469 homes.

Only 541 of these homes will be affordable, twenty-nine fewer than the indicative figure of 570 given to the same planning committee, were the redevelopment to be built to its maximum approved size.  The affordable housing is broken down into 92 social rented, 167 affordable rent and 282 shared ownership.

The 'anticipated' figures for the total and affordable units are given in planning documents for MP5, the final phase of the development - Table 7 of the [Reserved Matters Affordable Housing Strategy](http://35percent.org/img/epupdatedahstrategy.pdf) and Table 8.1 of the [Reconciliation Statement](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!ODWxL4QoZvkgXXbACxb5vg%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) for the [Elephant Park - MP5 H7 Reserved Matters Application](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=externalDocuments&keyVal=_STHWR_DCAPR_9582742).  The figure for the 570 approved affordable homes was given on page 9 of the planning committee's [addendum report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!Q7K%2bVQ5GwV3kVWHHRXBCqg%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d)   (correcting a previous figure of [574](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!swSywGCW3zgzV1miHXgXSg%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d)) (screen shot).

## MP5 - 15 social rent

For just MP5 itself Lendlease proposes 424 new homes, with 72 affordable units, made up of 20 affordable rent, 37 shared-ownership and 15 social rent.

This will take the total number of social rented units in the development to just 92, a figure that has crept up from [71 units](http://35percent.org/2013-01-13-will-the-planning-committee-see-sense/) since 2013 (plus a further [eight on Trafalgar Place](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!DcDunvLF2MOAcCag9FShbg%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) (Heygate Phase 1)).

## How planning works

The increase in the total number of units on Elephant Park has been facilitated by an [amendment](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=externalDocuments&keyVal=_STHWR_DCAPR_9580199) to the original planning permission, made back in Nov 2018.  This changed the way the amount of residential space was calculated by [replacing the minimum and maximum figures for residential units](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!s8fyBoziHiy%2fr1TPdwL8eQ%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) with floorspace figures. The floorspace figures remained the same as those [approved by the planning committee](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!hgyBVuEH%2b8BxXry2bGRAtA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d)   (160,579sqm GEA (min) and 254,400sqm GEA (max)), but by removing the unit figures the amendment enabled Lendlease to build more homes within the allowed floorspace.

It transpires that the [number of units to be built were not secured](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!RmPsohICrz2DqmiiC%2fGX%2fQ%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) in the original planning permission (screenshot), thus opening the door to the amendment, which was deemed 'non-material' (explain) and so was approved by officers and not referred back to the planning committee.

## Policy compliance

While Lendlease has not delivered the number of affordable homes approved by the planning committee, it is nonetheless able to say it is [fulfilling the affordable housing obligation of 25% affordable housing](http://35percent.org/img/epupdatedahstrategy.pdf).  This is because the amount of affordable housing is measured as a percentage of habitable rooms, not units (footnote - Table 8). The [officers report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!swSywGCW3zgzV1miHXgXSg%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) to the planning committee noted that there were a relatively high proportion of larger affordable units.
These are undoubtedly welcome, but do mean that there is just 20% affordable housing when measured by unit. 

## Viability questions

Officers at the time of the application's determination proposed only an early viability review in the limited circumstances that the development was delayed and no new viability assessment has been presented to take into account the increased number of total units or the fewer affordable units that will actually be delivered.

## No public funding?

The lack of available public funding was cited in the [officers report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!swSywGCW3zgzV1miHXgXSg%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) as a factor that diminished the chances of a viable scheme delivering the 35% affordable housing, when the application was originally considered.

![](http://35percent.org/img/gfunding1.png)

This came with the reassurance that should public funding become available, it could be used to improve the affordable housing position.  There is no indication that this has happened through the duration of Elephant Park's development, despite the [Mayor Sadiq Khan having £4.6bn in his kitty](https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/housing-and-land/homes-londoners-affordable-homes-programme-2016-21).

## Overage

## Object to MP5

combining these figures gives Lendlease 249 more freemarket homes, at a rough estimated value of £125m.

This has been achieved by clever variation of the original approval that allow the scheme to remain 'compliant' and without any referral back to the planning committee.

The application for MP5 has yet to be approved, but without objections will not go to planning committee.  This is an application which must be decided by the planning committee.  It must ask why we are getting fewer affordable housing units than promised, while Lendlease are building more units in total.  It must also ask why there have been no viablity assessements or reviews since 2012have been c

## Viability Review
The planning committee report also said that there would be viability reviews:

## Community Space
 Lendlease was required to build 1,000sqm of community space - this has been provided in the new 'energy centre' as a private creche.
Meanwhile, Southwark has had to purchase 600sqm of retail space from Lendlease (for £6m) to use as a library.

## Affordable retail strategy

Any opportunity for shopping centre traders to object?



 ( an increase of 220 more homes, over the maxiumum approved by the planning committee, 389 over the minimum approved.  When measured against the estimated amounts of affordable housing for the minimum approved 2300 homes  (including an estimated 19 more social rented units, but 27 fewer affordable rent at 50% market rent)
 
MP7's new homes will include 102 affordable units,

 But though this may explains the difference in percentage terms, it does not explain why the number of units is less than the planning committee expected.  The [officers report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!swSywGCW3zgzV1miHXgXSg%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d)) to the committee was aware that larger units meant a lower number would be affordable, but still gave a figure of 570

the number of units can be below 25% this was taken into account (OR para 166).

We can now see that by adding the increased maximum to fewer affordable units than expected  to the gained 249 more freemarket homes than the planning committee was led to believe would be built.  At a rough estimate, the value of these homes is £125m, a figure that obviously cannot have featured in the 2012 [viability assessment](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/HeygateViabilityAssessment_MainReport.pdf).  This was conducted on the basis of 2,462 units, not the amended increase to 2,689 units (screenshot development description) and determined that the scheme could not provide a policy compliant 35% affordable housing and that only a very small fraction of this could be social rented.  No new viability assessment taking this into account was submitted when Lendlease applied to [change how the amount of affordable housing was calculated](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?casereference=18/AP/3225&system=DC).
