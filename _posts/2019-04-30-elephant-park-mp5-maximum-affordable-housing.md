## At least 220 more homes, but fewer affordable.

The completion of the Heygate redevelopment is set to deliver more homes than were approved by Southwark's planning committee, but with fewer affordable homes.

The figures are revealed in a [planning document](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=externalDocuments&keyVal=_STHWR_DCAPR_9582742) for the last phase of the redevelopment of what is now known as Elephant Park -  MP7. This phase is for 424 new homes, taking the total for the whole development to 2,689 homes. This is at least 220 more homes than the numbers agreed at the planning committee in November 2013, when Lendlease recieved planning permission for between 2,300 and 2,469 homes.

Despite this increase in the total planning documents show that despite the increase in the total, only 541 of these homes will be affordable - 29 fewer than the 570 promised.


When the planning committee approved the Heygate estate's redevelopment back in 2013 it thought it was approving a scheme of _'between 2,300(min) and 2,469(max) residential units'_.  It also thought it was approving a minimum of 570 affordable homes, the 'indicative figure' given in an [addendum report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!Q7K%2bVQ5GwV3kVWHHRXBCqg%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) (footnote; corrected from 574, para 163 [Officer's report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!swSywGCW3zgzV1miHXgXSg%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d).

In fact, at least 220 more homes will be built over the maximum, but with fewer affordable homes than approved.  This is according to planning documents submitted by developer Lendlease for the last phase of the Heygate redevelopment (now known as Elephant Park). 

The new figures are in the [updated affordable housing strategy](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?casereference=19/AP/1166&system=DC) for the [detailed planning application](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=externalDocuments&keyVal=_STHWR_DCAPR_9582742) for plot H7, phase MP5.  This new strategy gives an anticipated total of 2,689 residential units for the whole development, with 2,148 of these private, leaving 541 as affordable, thirty nine fewer than the committee was led to believe would be provided, if there was a maximum build-out.  The affordable housing is broken down into 92 social rented, 167 affordable rent and 282 shared ownership. (Table 7) 

## How planning works


An [amendment](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=externalDocuments&keyVal=_STHWR_DCAPR_9580199) made back in Nov 2018 facilitated the increase in the total number of homes.  This changed the way the amount of residential space was calculated by [replacing the minimum and maximum figures for residential units](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!s8fyBoziHiy%2fr1TPdwL8eQ%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) with floorspace figures. The floorspace figures remained the same as those [approved by the planning committee](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!hgyBVuEH%2b8BxXry2bGRAtA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d)   (para 81- 160,579sqm GEA (min) and 254,400sqm GEA (max)), but by removing the unit figures the amendment enabled Lendlease to build more homes within the allowed floorspace.

Thsi significant change was deemed 'non-material' (explain) and so was not referred back to the planning committee, but approved by officers.

Notwithstanding Lendlease's failure to deliver the number of affordable homes approved by the planning, it is nonetheless able to say it is meeting the planning approval requirement of 25% affordable housing, half rented, half shared-ownership.  This is because the the amount of affordable housing is measured by habitable room, not units and there is a relatively greater number of larger affordable housing rented units (OR para 166). On this basis Lendlease is able to [claim it is delivering 25.8% affordable housing](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?casereference=19/AP/1166&system=DC), in almost the correct proportions, between rent and shared ownership (footnote - Table 8).

## Heygate estate - the endgame

the submission of detailed planning application for (one of the plots) in the last phase of Elephant Park has been [submitted](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?casereference=19/AP/1166&system=DC) and the [planning documents](http://35percent.org/img/epupdatedahstrategy.pdf) show that of the 424 homes proposed in this phase (220 more than were originally approved), just 15 will be social rent.

MP5 fifth and final phase. It has two plots H1 and H7; application is being made to develope H7 with 424 units.  This is all the units for MP5 (Reserved matters affordable housing statement 19/AP/0025, Table 7); what's happening to H1?

The officer's report for the outline planning application said that there was currently no grant funding available and that this is one of the reasons why the affordable housing offer is not compliant.

But it did say that that should it become available then there would be a revised affordable housing offer.

## Viability Review
The planning committee report also said that there would be viability reviews:

## Community Space
 Lendlease was required to build 1,000sqm of community space - this has been provided in the new 'energy centre' as a private creche.
Meanwhile, Southwark has had to purchase 600sqm of retail space from Lendlease (for Â£6m) to use as a library.
