In 2014, as part of its manifesto pledge Southwark Council's administration [announced](http://www.southwarklabour.co.uk/latest-news/southwark/news.aspx?p=102262) an _"ambitious but realistic plan to build 11,000 new council homes"_ across the borough over the next 30 years. Concerns were [raised by us](http://35percent.org/the-southwark-clearances) and [by others](https://crappistmartin.github.io/images/SNHeygateOverage.pdf) that this would be insufficient to cover the number of council homes lost to ongoing estate regeneration, void disposal polices and Right to Buy applications over the next 30 years.

Council leader Peter John subsequently issued an [open letter](http://35percent.org/img/pj11000councilhomesletter.pdf). In the letter, Councillor John asserted that the 11,000 council homes would be over and above the existing stock count - i.e. a net increase:

Councillor John went one step further to pledge that the first 1500 new council homes would be finished by 2018:

Now, having reached 2018, we took a look at whether Councillor John has delivered on his manifesto pledge. [Official statistics](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/674346/LT_116.xlsx) from the government's [live tables](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/live-tables-on-dwelling-stock-including-vacants) on local authority dwelling stock show that since the manifesto pledge in 2014 there has been a net reduction in Southwark's council housing stock of 476 council homes.

*Extract from the government's [Live Table 116](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/674346/LT_116.xlsx)*

The government's statistics don't yet include figures for 2018, but with [GLA housing delivery data](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/affordable_housing_starts_and_completions_-_end_of_june_2018.xls) showing that just 12 social rented homes were completed in Southwark between April 2017 and March 2018.

Faced with these facts some might suggest that Councillor John's manifesto pledge is nothing but meaningless PR spin..

## A different ... .. 
We are not saying that Southwark hasn't built any new council homes; it [claims](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/housing/major-works-and-new-homes/new-homes/new-homes-delivery?chapter=2) to have built 291 so far (without providing a full breakdown). It just clearly hasn't built enough to compete with the pace at which it is knocking its existing council homes down or selling them off.

Conscious of its manifesto commitment and problems finding enough space to build all the new council homes it has promised, Southwark is now turning to a different strategy - buying section 106 homes. These are the rented element of affordable homes in new developments that a developer is obliged to build in accordance with planning policy.

One such example is 

_"By buying up section 106 properties Southwark Council is not adding to the amount of social housing stock in the borough. It is simply buying homes that already exist and that housing associations would have otherwise bought and let as social housing.”_

## Where's the money coming from?

Southwark has also been selling off its [Town Halls](http://35percent.org/southwark-town-halls/) and street properties. In 2009, Southwark Council introduced a policy of selling off every council home that becomes void and is valued above £400,000. In 2011 this was [reviewed by the incoming Labour administration which reduced](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s19458/Report%20Review%20of%20Void%20Disposal%20Strategy.pdf) the threshold to £300,000. Here are some of the properties [sold at auction](http://35percent.org/img/sold_by_southwark.pdf) by the current (Labour) administration under this policy:
