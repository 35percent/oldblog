We [blogged last year](http://35percent.org/2019-08-05-elephant-park-final-phase-affordable-housing/) about the final phase of the Heygate regeneration, which is set to see an increase in the overall number of homes and a decrease in the number of affordable. 

The application is now set to be approved by the Council's planning committee on [Monday 24th February](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=119&MId=6403&Ver=4).

We [argued](http://35percent.org/2019-08-05-elephant-park-final-phase-affordable-housing/) that the original outline consent had envisaged both a viability review and the seeking of grant funding.

The [Planning committee report for this final phase](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/files/2B05D1FEBF0308C39F18968F194D473F/pdf/19_AP_1166--843567.pdf) said that despite being confirmed in the [outline consent's planning committee report]() neither obligation had been written any contractual obligation. 

> There is no obligation on Lendlease to seek public funds (para 283).

This is contradicted by para .. of the [Regeneration Agreement](https://files.whatdotheyknow.com/request/heygate_estate_development_partn/191203%2020141201_Lend%20Lease_2014%20Deed%20of%20Variation_COMPLETE.pdf%20EIR%201351433_Redacted.pdf) which says:

The planning committee report also claims:

>The  council has  no  mechanism  to  insist  on  a  viability review (para 129)

This is contradicted by para xx of the [Regeneration Agreement](https://files.whatdotheyknow.com/request/heygate_estate_development_partn/191203%2020141201_Lend%20Lease_2014%20Deed%20of%20Variation_COMPLETE.pdf%20EIR%201351433_Redacted.pdf) which says:
