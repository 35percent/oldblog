We [blogged last year](http://35percent.org/2019-08-05-elephant-park-final-phase-affordable-housing/) about the final phase (MP5 H7) of the Heygate regeneration. 

Lendlease's application for 424 new homes is now set to be approved by the Council's planning committee on [Monday](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=119&MId=6403&Ver=4).

If approved it will set the seal on an increase in the number of new homes beyond that approved by Southwark's planning committee back in 2013, without any increase in the number of affordable homes. This will result in 2,689 homes (220 more than approved in 2013) of which 92 will be social rent. 

This windfall gives Lendlease the revenue of 220 extra homes, that was not included in the original viability assessment for the scheme - which was based on 2,469 units. This allowed Lendlease to build 25% instead of 35% affordable housing and reduce the required amount of social rented homes to next to nothing. Taking account of the 220 extra homes could have improved the viability of the whole scheme and the affordable housing offer.

## Reviewing viability
We [noted](http://35percent.org/2019-08-05-elephant-park-final-phase-affordable-housing/#viability-questions) in our previous blog that Southwark neglected to carry out any viability review.

Monday's [planning committee report](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/files/2B05D1FEBF0308C39F18968F194D473F/pdf/19_AP_1166--843567.pdf) reiterates that:

> "The council has no mechanism to insist on a viability review" (para 129)

This looks to be contrdicted by the terms of the [Regeneration Agreement](https://files.whatdotheyknow.com/request/heygate_estate_development_partn/191203%2020141201_Lend%20Lease_2014%20Deed%20of%20Variation_COMPLETE.pdf%20EIR%201351433_Redacted.pdf) between Southwark and Lendlease provides a mechanism for the affordable housing mix to be reviewed on an annual basis.

If these annual reviews had been taking place it should have been reflected in higher levels of social rented housing. The fact that the tenure mix hasn't changed suggests that they haven't.

## Grant Funding
We also noted in our [previous blogpost] that the 2013 planning committee anticipated that Elephant Park could benefit from public funding if it became available.

This was in line with the [Regeneration Agreement](https://files.whatdotheyknow.com/request/heygate_estate_development_partn/191203%2020141201_Lend%20Lease_2014%20Deed%20of%20Variation_COMPLETE.pdf%20EIR%201351433_Redacted.pdf) which also obliged the parties to seek grant funding:

![](http://35percent.org/img/fundingra.png)

Such funding has been available since 2016 when Sadiq Khan [announced](https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/housing-and-land/homes-londoners-affordable-homes-programme-2016-21) a Â£4.6bn funding programme, but Lendlease hasn't applied for it.

Despite the 2013 planning committee's intention and the Regeneration Agreement's obligation, in Monday's [committee report for the final phase]() Southwark now states:

> "There is no obligation on Lendlease to seek public funds." (para 283)

But, we say that unless Lendlease applies for grant funding then Southwark should reject this final phase application.

Southwark should also reject the application unless Lendlease commits to a viability review.

There are a number of reasons why a viability review is necessary. Not only was the original viability assessment based on fewer homes than the number actually being built, but also those homes are being [sold for twice Lendlease's viability assessment estimate](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jun/25/london-developers-viability-planning-affordable-social-housing-regeneration-oliver-wainwright).

Another significant change to viability since the original assessment has been Lendlease's recent [decision](https://www.constructionenquirer.com/2018/01/17/lendlease-launches-1-5bn-build-to-rent-partnership/) to let rather than sell homes in the later phases of the scheme.

In terms of policy, Monday's planning committee should take account of Policy 3.12 of the Mayor's [London Plan](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/the_london_plan_malp_final_for_web_0606_0.pdf), which says that _"The maximum reasonable amount of affordable housing should be sought .. having regard to .. individual circumstances including development viability, {and} the availability of public subsidy._"
