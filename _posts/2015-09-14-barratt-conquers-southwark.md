## Chambers Wharf
It is starting to look like [tenure switches](/redefining-social-rent) have become routine practice for new developments in Southwark. The arrangement suits both developers and 
the council, who can [claim the credit](http://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/100-affordable-homes-open-on-brownfield-site/) for delivering new social rented housing, which is in actual fact affordable rent.

We recently discovered such a tenure switch at __Chambers Wharf__, 
Berkeley Homes' latest development on Southwark's riverside. In May this year, 
Councillor Williams 
[proclaimed](http://www.berkeleygroup.co.uk/press-releases/2015/southwark-development-sets-new-standard-for-affordable-housing-in-london) 
the completion of _"106 social rented apartments and 14 social rented family 
homes,"_ which he claimed was proof that the council is _"tackling the housing 
crisis head on and are doing all we can to build the quality affordable homes 
our residents so desperately need"_.  But what Councillor Williams' press 
statement didn't say was that the 89 of the social rented homes had been 
converted to affordable rents of 65% market rent by [mutual 
agreement](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieDecisionDetails.aspx?Id=3617) 
with the council, following a 'viability review' of the scheme in 2013.
