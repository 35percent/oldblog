New apartments in [Dephini apartments](https://www.barratthomes.co.uk/new-homes/greater-london/H625601-Blackfriars-circus/), the latest phase of Barratt's [__Blackfriars Circus__](http://www.barratthomes.co.uk/new-homes/greater-london/H625601-Blackfriars-circus/) development have been available since the beginning of the year, but there are still some available, if you hurry, starting at £595k for a studio flat.

Barratt Homes is Britains third-largest housebuilder, and [it made £321m](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2017/02/22/profits-rise-barratt-despite-uks-biggest-housebuilder-building/ in the first half of 2016) before tax in the second half of last year, a profit rise of 9%. This continued Barrett's steady profit climb since 2010, [part of the explosion of housebuilders' profits](http://www.ourcity.london/issues/viability/house_builders_profits/) over the past five years. 

Barratt's success is due in part to its pipeline of major developments in Southwark, which include [__Maple Quays__](http://www.barratthomes.co.uk/new-homes/greater-london/h469201-maple-quays/) (668 homes in phase 1 of the [Canada Water regeneration](/canada-water/)); [__the Galleria__](http://www.barratthomes.co.uk/new-homes/greater-london/track-record---article-pages/the-galleria/) development in Peckham; [__Redwood Park__](http://www.barratthomes.co.uk/new-homes/greater-london/h309201-redwood-park/) (212 homes on former council land at Surrey Quays) and the 60-acre, 3,500-home Aylesbury estate redevelompent for which Barratt is Notting Hill Housing's [development partner](http://www.nottinghillhousing.org.uk/our-developments/aylesbury-estate-southwark).


The [__Blackfriars Circus__](http://www.barratthomes.co.uk/new-homes/greater-london/H625601-Blackfriars-circus/) 
development overlooks the South Bank University campus at the Elephant & Castle and comprises 336 new homes in 5 buildings ranging up to 27 storeys 
in height. 
According to [SE1 website](http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/8441) the 
tallest of these will be known as __'The Conquest Apartments'__. This is an 
appropriate name for a development that was able to dupe Southwark council into 
waiving the tenure requirements of its 35% affordable housing Policy. These 
would have secured a minimum 70 social rented homes in the development, but 
Barratt submitted a viability assessment claiming it would only be viable to 
provide 8 social rented homes and 48 affordable rent homes. The [officer's 
report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!5wmNTTJlhAE1P%2fSH390aXg%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) 
explains that the council had the viability assessment appraised by the 
'Borough Valuer' and that _"Whilst a number of inputs into the valuation have 
been agreed (including commercial values, ground rents, and professional fees) 
an agreement has not been reached on two fundamental matters: methodology of 
calculating the benchmark value of the site; and residential sale values. As 
such, the applicant and the Borough Valuer have not reached an agreed position 
about how much affordable housing can be delivered on site."_ (para. 109)

Nevertheless the planning application was waved through and demolition works started on the site earlier this year. However, it is now being [reported](http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/8441) that the council is planning to buy these 8 social and 48 affordable rented homes from Barratt, in order to turn them into social rented council homes at a cost of £10m.

The absurdity of buying homes from developers to convert to social rent when they should have been social rent anyway, is plain for all to see.
However, it also appears that Southwark is paying well over the market price: the £10m price tag for 56 affordable housing units seems an awful lot compared to the [£3.1m paid](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/LR_LANDQ_TrafalgarPlace.pdf) by L&Q for 54 affordable homes it brought from Heygate developer Lend Lease at [Trafalgar Place](http://trafalgarplace.com). 

## Maple Quays
![](http://pbs.twimg.com/media/CKr8DTiWUAAJn7n.jpg)
In 2013, Barratt completed its [__Maple Quays__](http://www.barratthomes.co.uk/new-homes/greater-london/h469201-maple-quays/) development at Canada Water. This first phase of the [Canada Water regeneration](/canada-water/) comprised 9 buildings ranging up to 26 storeys, providing 668 residential units of which 123 were supposed to be social rent - according to the council's [planning report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!vAhB%2bWXWLqfrJmcf89aX8A%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) for the planning application:

However, when the [section 106 legal agreement](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!x3RgHHSbSY10notKcDq0rQ%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) was drawn up, there was no mention of social rented housing - only __'affordable rent'__ (i.e. 80% market rent):

## Chambers Wharf
It is starting to look this these tenure switches have become routine practice 
for new developments in Southwark. The arrangement suits both developers and 
the council, who can [claim the 
credit](http://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/100-affordable-homes-open-on-brownfield-site/) 
for delivering new social rented housing, which is in actual fact affordable 
rent.  We recently discovered such a tenure switch at __Chambers Wharf__, 
Berkeley Homes' latest development on Southwark's riverside. In May this year, 
Councillor Williams 
[proclaimed](http://www.berkeleygroup.co.uk/press-releases/2015/southwark-development-sets-new-standard-for-affordable-housing-in-london) 
the completion of _"106 social rented apartments and 14 social rented family 
homes,"_ which he claimed was proof that the council is _"tackling the housing 
crisis head on and are doing all we can to build the quality affordable homes 
our residents so desperately need"_.  But what Councillor Williams' press 
statement didn't say was that the 89 of the social rented homes had been 
converted to affordable rents of 65% market rent by [mutual 
agreement](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieDecisionDetails.aspx?Id=3617) 
with the council, following a 'viability review' of the scheme in 2013.

## Will the Aylesbury follow suit?
Questions are being asked whether the replacement __social rented__ housing on London's largest council estate redevelopment scheme will meet the same fate, i.e. end up being delivered as __affordable rent__?

Three weeks ago the council published its [Section 106 agreement](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/AylesburyS106.pdf) with Notting Hill Housing for the Aylesbury redevelopment, which covers both the __First Development Site__ (__FDS__ - phase one) and the __Outline Development Site__ (the rest of the scheme). We have had a thorough read of the agreement and have got some serious concerns about the wording, which we think could open the door to interpretation as __affordable rent__ on the Outline Site.  

Our main concern is that the agreement's affordable housing schedule prescribes __'social rented'__ housing for the __First Development Site__ (__FDS__), but the wording for the __Outline Site__ has omitted the word __'rented'__ and says just __'social'__ housing. Given the fact that there is no definition elsewhere in the agreement for the term ‘Social’, we are worried that any future legal dispute over the interpretation of this term may fall back on the statutory definition, which includes affordable rent under the broad definition of ‘social’ housing in [section 68 of the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2008/17/section/68).

![](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/aylesburyAHschedule.png) 

Of additional concern is that various references can be found in the agreement in relation to social rented housing on the __FDS__, but there are no specific references to social rented housing in relation to the __Outline Site__:  

![](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/AylesburyS106_pg42.png) 

We have written a [letter](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/AylesburyS106_CllrWilliams.pdf) to Councillor Williams setting out our concerns in detail and requesting that the S106 agreement be amended.  

If the council and Notting Hill are __genuinely__ committed to the provision of __social rented__ rather than __affordable rented__ housing on the Aylesbury, then we see no reason why they wouldn't agree to these amendments.
