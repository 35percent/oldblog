The Local Government Ombudsman has issued a [damning judgement](/img/LGOFinalDecisionSOR.pdf), slamming Southwark for having no procedures to ensure that levels of affordable housing agreed by the Council's planning committee are actually delivered. 

The decision came in response to a lengthy investigation inititated as a result of our [Dec 2015 corporate complaint] 

In March 2015, we discovered that Notting Hill Housing Association had delivered affordable rented homes at up to 62% market rent, instead of social rent which had been the tenure agreed in the planning consent.

## BERMONDSEY SPA SITE C5 (10/AP/3010)
This application was made by Notting Hill Housing Trust, for the redevelopment of 54 council homes as part of the Bermondsey Spa regeneration and was approved by planning committee On 21st December 2010. Permission allowed for the demolition of a number of Council homes and construction of 205 new homes, some commercial and community premises and associated works. 
Our [2015 blog post](http://www.the-exchange-london.com/web/images/01/gallery/exterior/camera-2.jpg) covers the development in more detail, showing how the 44 social rented homes were provide at affordable rents of up to 62% market rent.
This is the one scheme that the Council has responded to in our complaint. It considers the matter resolved, partly through having secured a number of social rented units from Notting Hill Housing Trust at its [Manor Place depot development](http://35percent.org/manor-place-depot/). However, these units were required to meet the affordable housing quota for that site and therefore cannot be used to offset the shortfall at the Bermondsey Spa redevelopment (there remains a net loss of social rented housing across the two sites).
