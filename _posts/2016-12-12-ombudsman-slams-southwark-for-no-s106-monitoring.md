subtitle: Ombudsman finds that Council cannot know how much social housing it is getting

The Local Government Ombudsman has issued the [damning judgement](http://35percent.org/img/LGOFinalDecisionSOR.pdf) that Southwark Council has had no procedure to ensure that social housing approved by the Council's planning committee is actually being delivered.  The Ombudsman further found that without a monitoring procedure 'it is hard to know ..how many social housing units...developers [have] delivered'.   

![](http://35percent.org/img/LGOFinalDecisionSOR.png "Ombudsman decision")

 Private developers and housing associations should provide social rented housing as a proportion of their housing schemes and the amount is written into their planning consents.  The Ombudsman's decision came after the 35% Campaign [complained](http://35percent.org/img/Ombudsman18July2016.pdf)that planning consents were being breached, listing 42 developments where we thought the social rented housing may not have been delivered as required.

In her [decision notice](http://35percent.org/img/LGOFinalDecisionSOR.pdf), the Ombudsman said that:

>In response to my enquiries the Council says it is taking legal action in response to several of the breaches identified by Mr X. It also accepts it did not have a systematic supervision procedure to check compliance. It relied on developers’ voluntary compliance. (para. 12)

She concludes that _'the Council accepts that fault'_ and has agreed to roll out _'a borough-wide annual audit to ensure compliance'_, nevertheless noting that _'until that audit is complete it is hard to know how many social housing units all section 106 agreements called for and how many developers delivered. Or indeed, how many remain social housing units.'_

Despite the Ombudsmans' decision and Southwark's own admission that it had no monitoring procedure in place, , no further action is proposed in any of the other instances submitted,aside from the two cases subject to legal action (the Jam Factory and Signal Tower).  This leaves unresolved issues about the levels of rent being charged for purportedly social rented properties.

## Background

Our complaint was prompted after we [discovered](http://35percent.org/2015-03-18-stand-up-for-more-social-housing/)in March 2015 that 44 social rented units had been lost from the Bermondsey Spa development and had instead been switched to affordable rent, at 62% market rent, by housing provider Notting Hill Housing Trust (NHHT).  

![](http://35percent.org/img/bspaexchange.png)

The lost Bermondsey Spa homes were raised at the Aylesbury estate CPO inquiry in April/May 2015. The Council assured the inquiry that it had robust procedures in place and that it monitored compliance of S106 affordable housing provision every 12-18 months.  There was therefore no possibility of NHHT failing to deliver social rented housing in its redevelopment of the Aylesbury. This was evidently not true.

Southwark struck a deal with NHHT to reprovide the 44 lost social rented units on another site, Manor Place depot.  This deal dounble counted the social rented units for both sites, so there was still a net loss of 44 units took and in any event the development has not been built, so we are still without these homes, 6 years after they recieved planning permission.

## Social rent is not affordable rent

Social rent is determined by a legal formula and only a small part of the calculation takes in market rents; social rent equates  to between 19-25% market rate in Southwark(link). Our [list] (http://35percent.org/img/section106_tenure_breaches.pdf)of suspect developments shows many where the level of rent identifies them as affordable rent, not social rent.  The list was compliled by cross-checking planning committee reports, section 106 agreements, Land Registry information, the [GLA affordable housing outturn dataset](http://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/gla-affordable-housing-programme-outturn/resource/0c87e5dc-f1e9-4edf-b246-bef6b40a9ba3) and [CORE lettings data](https://core.communities.gov.uk/).

## Colorama buildings

![](http://35percent.org/img/colorama_chroma.jpg)

This redevelopment of the former [Colorama film processing warehouse](http://35percent.org/colorama/) in SE1 was completed in April 2016 and should have provided a total of 19 social rented habitable rooms, about 8 units, according to the [planning report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!Zz6kQSuw9WcG1eGU1VRSAg%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d).  

However, Greater London Authority [affordable housing outturn data](http://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/gla-affordable-housing-programme-outturn/resource/0c87e5dc-f1e9-4edf-b246-bef6b40a9ba3), shows that the developer had provided affordable rented units not social rented. These range up to 59% market rent, giving rent levels of £215pw (excl. service charge) for a 1-bed flat, over twice the current average social rent in Southwark ([£100 pw](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/news/article/1738/southwark_council_keeping_social_rent_affordable_for_londoners)).

![](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/coloramagladata.png)

The scheme (now branded the ['Chroma Buildings'](http://www.fabrica.co.uk/The-Chroma-Buildings)) has completed and new residents moved in. 

## 143-149 Rye Lane/1-15 Bournemouth Road Peckham - SE15 4ST 

![](http://35percent.org/img/landqryelane.png)

Southwark's [planning committee report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!yP1lK1SBYnvpeezqHiCudA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) (06/AP/0995) approved 61 new homes of which 7 should have been social rented units, but the GLA dataset shows that these have been delivered by London & Quadrant as affordable rents of between 74% and 78% market rent.

## 32 Crosby Row SE1 3PT

![](http://35percent.org/img/crosbyrow.png)

Southwark's [planning committee report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!gKqBYbE9RsCLZlddMhjvOA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) (11/AP/0140) approved the [demolition](http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/5235) of St Hugh's church on Crosby Row and the construction of 22 new homes, which should have included 5 social rented units. But the GLA dataset shows that these have been delivered by Family Mosaic as affordable rent at up to 57% of market rent.

## 177-184 Grange Road, Bermondsey (Linden Homes Ltd)

![](http://35percent.org/img/177-184GrangeRoad.png)

The [planning committee report](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s21421/Item%201%20report.pdf) (11/AP/1390) for this development approved 38 new homes, of which 9 were supposed to be social rented units. The GLA data shows that these have been delivered by Leicester Housing Association as affordable rents of up to 52% market rent.

## 34-42 Grange Road, Bermondsey (Bellway Homes)

![](http://35percent.org/img/twistgrangeroad.png)

Southwark's [planning committee report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!zsXhZcwMT4Yjxyeq6tsl1w%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) (11/AP/3251) approved 41 new homes of which 8 social rented, but the GLA dataset shows that these have been delivered by Leicester Housing Association at affordable rents of up to 52% market rent.

## Royal Road, Kennington (09/AP/2388)

![](http://35percent.org/img/royalroad.jpg)

This development was built on the site of a former old people's home. The Council sold the site (at cost) to Affinity Sutton housing association as it was designated as one of the [replacement housing sites](http://embed.verite.co/timeline/?source=0Aprl6XcACewydEhRaWFOLVBfUjBSVW1HUGVZNEhGeFE&font=Bevan-PotanoSans&maptype=toner&lang=en&hash_bookmark=true&start_zoom_adjust=2&height=650#15) for decanted Heygate tenants. Notwithstanding this, the development was completed 5 years after the last Heygate tenant was decanted and the 76 social rented homes consented were described as 'affordable rent' in the S106 agreement. The government's [CORE lettings database](https://core.communities.gov.uk) is showing only 45 units let at social rents at this site.

## 430 Old Kent Road SE1 5AG - (Family Mosaic development)

![](http://35percent.org/img/430okr.png)

This is one of the [Neo-Bankside](http://35percent.org/neo-bankside) off-site affordable housing sites, which according to Southwark's [planning committee report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!siQ3eaBQc4N16%2bb1RFDnxQ%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) (11/AP/0138) approved 22 social rented units, but the GLA dataset shows that these have been delivered by Family Mosaic at affordable rents of up to 49% market rent.

## Silwood estate regeneration Site 4B (11/AP/0139)

![](http://35percent.org/img/silwoodstreet.png)

This is yet another Notting Hill Housing association redevelopment of a council estate. It was supposed to provide 22 social rented homes as part of its [redevelopment of the Silwood estate](/silwood-estate-regeneration) involving the demolition of 57 council homes and construction of 127 new homes. The the definition of social rented in the section 106 agreement is worded as affordable rent and the [CORE lettings data system](https://core.communities.gov.uk/) shows that only 19 units have been let at social rent levels. 

Conclusion

Southwark has acknowledged that up until now it has not ensured that social rented housing has been delivered in accordance with planning approvals, but relied on 'volunary compliance'.    Southwark promises an annual public audit as a remedy, with some unspecified 'further investigation to ensure accuracy' and has budgetted £60,000 for this.  Developers and, unfortunately, housing associations have demonstrated that they cannot be trusted, so doubt that this will be enough.
Southwark charges developers a 2% administration fee on the sum total of financial S106 contributions agreed, for, among other things the purpose of monitoring S106 conditions. The table below shows this amounts to a considerable sum each year and far more of it should be invested to ensure that the S106 affordable housing conditions are properly monitored and enforced.

We also need an audit not just 'going forward' but also one looking back, an historical audit of all relevant planning applications for an least the past 10 years, to retreive the social housing that Southwark has lost through being let at highher than social rents.  Only when Southwark has done this will we believe that 'the Council is committed to maximising the supply of new social rented homes in Southwark' as it claimed in its response to out compliant (link)
