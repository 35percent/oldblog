Further research as a follow-up to our [previous blog post](/2014-04-15-the-elephants-new-ivory-towers/) has uncovered some unexpected connections between the Elephant & Castle and offshore tax havens. These are outlined as follows:

1. First and foremost, are the [Tribeca Square](/tribeca-square) and [shopping centre](/shopping-centre) developers Delancey DV4, whose dodgy offshore tax avoidance schemes are [well reported](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/PrivateEyeNo1311.pdf). Delancey has registered its shopping centre site using a shell company (Elephant & Castle Properties (BVI)) set up in the British Virgin Islands. Likewise, its neighbouring Tribeca Square development is [registered](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/LandRegistry_TribecaSquare.pdf) in the British Virgin Islands. Delancey is also now reported to be developing the LCC site, which well end up putting half the Elephant & Castle into the hands of a BVI based company that pays zero UK tax.

2. Strata Tower was developed and owned by a SPV(Special Purpose Vehicle) company [registered](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/RegisterTGL251176.pdf) on the Isle of Man. Some of the penthouses are also [registered](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/StrataPenthouseLRRegister.pdf) to a SPV holding company on the Isle of Man and an offshore company called 'Gamma Civic', which is [registered](/img/LRegister_strata_penthouse.pdf) in Mauritius. 

3. Eileen house is being developed by a [company](https://opencorporates.com/companies/im/113350C) based on the Isle of Man and which also [helps its customers](http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/dec/16/london-property-tax-avoidance-offshore) avoid stamp duty by setting up SPV's on the Isle to buy the finished flats.

Heygate developer Lend Lease's global corporate structure is too complex for us to see whether it shares its fellow developer's fondness of offshore companies. However, we have found that its development arm - Lend Lease Residential PLC [doesn't pay](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/lendleasefinancialreport.pdf) a penny in UK corporation tax. 

Last year Lend Lease UK's parent company in Australia [recorded](http://phx.corporate-ir.net/External.File?item=UGFyZW50SUQ9MjA0NTA3fENoaWxkSUQ9LTF8VHlwZT0z&t=1) an annual profit of over £300m.

Lend Lease has no inhibitions about profiting from public assets though. As well as the Heygate and ['One the Elephant'](http://www.35percent.org/2014-01-11-flogging-the-elephant) developments - both on public land - it was Lend Lease's development arm which [bought](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/millennium-dome-the-white-elephant-that-learnt-to-fly-8157301.html) the Millenium dome plus 150 acres of Greenwich Peninsula for the princely sum of just £1. It [built the Olympic Village](http://www.thelondonmagazine.co.uk/property-experts/expert-opinions/the-olympic-village.html) with the help of hundreds of millions in public funding, and has used more former public land for a [£1.3bn scheme](http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=186950&p=RssLanding&cat=news&id=1888917) at Stratford.  

We are about to get into a fresh range of ‘consultations’ for several major developments, including that for the shopping centre, and will no doubt hear the usual claims about the benefits they will bring to the community - the developers have to secure vital planning approvals, after all. The first condition of planning approval should be that the developer will not suck all the financial reward, not just out of the Elephant, but out of the country.

## Aylesbury Regeneration - social rent or affordable rent?
Southwark Council has just signed up Notting Hill Trust as its development partner for the Aylesbury estate regeneration and this week saw an [article](http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/south-london-housing-estate-that-tony-blair-forgot-set-to-be-rebuilt-9309864.html) in the Evening Standard praising the regeneration plans for not following the bad example of the Heygate. While we agree that the plans do look better on paper - half of the 3,500 new properties will be ‘affordable’, of which three-quarters will be for social rent – a small alarm bell has been rung by the language used in the regeneration documents to describe the social housing element.
In the [legal agreement](http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/279910_1.pdf) for the most recent phase of the Aylesbury redevelopment [site 7](http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/lq-wins-work-on-next-phase-of-aylesbury-plan/6522708.article), the definition of 'social rented' worryingly refers to the [HCA definition](http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/ourwork/affordable-rent) of Boris's 'affordable rented' housing product of up to 80% market rents:

Also, there is no reference to the National Rent Regime in site 7's legal agreement. This is the regulatory framework which decides the level of social rents based - among other things - on the average level of income, and it is standard practice for definitions in these legal agreements to include a reference to the National Rent Regime. Below is an example of the wording normally used in a standard legal agreement used for securing social rented housing:

So the worry is – what will the rent be for the new social housing?  A social rent in the Aylesbury’s SE17 area is currently about £115 pw for a 2-bed flat; on the other hand one of Mayor Johnson’s ‘affordable rents would be way beyond this at around £350pw if it were at 80% of market rent.
