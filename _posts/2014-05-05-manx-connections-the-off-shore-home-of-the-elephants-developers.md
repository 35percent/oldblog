Since being bought up by dicey developer Delancey, the Elephant & Castle's land ownership has been registered to shell companies in three seperate tax havens: Bermuda, Panama and the British Virgin Islands. 

Delancey has registered both the [shopping centre](/shopping-centre) site and the [Tribeca Square](/tribeca-square) site in the British Virgin Islands. This is confirmed by the Land Registry deeds, which can be viewed [here](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/LRDeeds_ShoppingCentre.pdf) and [here](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/LandRegistry_TribecaSquare.pdf). Delancey has financed the purchases using one of its venture capital funds 'Delancey DV4', whose offshore tax avoidance schemes are [well reported](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/PrivateEyeNo1311.pdf) and have been accused by HMRC of 'aggressive tax avoidance. One of Delancey's [funders is George Soros](http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-1583098/Soros-offers-a-helping-hand-to-Ritblat-junior.html), the currency speculator who brought the country to its knees during [black wednesday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Wednesday) in 1992.

Delancey uses separate companies to develop the sites and in the case of [Tribeca Square](tribeca-square) has used a [partnership company controlled by shell companies](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/OC389454/officers) in British Virgin Islands and Panama.

Delancey is also now reported to be developing the LCC site, which well end up putting half the Elephant & Castle into the hands of a BVI based company that pays zero UK tax.

Delancey is not alone in its offshore strategy, Strata Tower was developed and owned by a SPV(Special Purpose Vehicle) company [registered](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/RegisterTGL251176.pdf) on the Isle of Man. Some of the penthouses are also [registered](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/StrataPenthouseLRRegister.pdf) to a SPV holding company on the Isle of Man and an offshore company called 'Gamma Civic', which is [registered](/img/LRegister_strata_penthouse.pdf) in Mauritius. 

[O'Central](http://83cramptonstreet.co.uk/), [South Central](http://oakmayneproperties.com/oakmayne-properties/portfolio/south-central-east/) and [Eileen house](/eileen-house) are being developed by 'Oakmayne' - a [company](https://opencorporates.com/companies/im/113350C) based on the Isle of Man and which also [helps its customers](http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/dec/16/london-property-tax-avoidance-offshore) avoid stamp duty by setting up SPV's on the Isle to buy the finished flats.

Heygate developer Lendlease's global corporate structure is too complex for us to see whether it shares its fellow developer's fondness of offshore companies. However, we have found that its development arm - Lend Lease Residential PLC [doesn't pay](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/lendleasefinancialreport.pdf) a penny in UK corporation tax. 

Last year Lendlease UK's parent company in Australia [recorded](http://phx.corporate-ir.net/External.File?item=UGFyZW50SUQ9MjA0NTA3fENoaWxkSUQ9LTF8VHlwZT0z&t=1) an annual profit of over £300m.

Lendlease has no inhibitions about profiting from public assets though. As well as the Heygate and ['One the Elephant'](http://www.35percent.org/2014-01-11-flogging-the-elephant) developments - both on public land - it was Lend Lease's development arm which [bought](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/millennium-dome-the-white-elephant-that-learnt-to-fly-8157301.html) the Millenium dome plus 150 acres of Greenwich Peninsula for the princely sum of just £1. It [built the Olympic Village](http://www.thelondonmagazine.co.uk/property-experts/expert-opinions/the-olympic-village.html) with the help of hundreds of millions in public funding, and has used more former public land for a [£1.3bn scheme](http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=186950&p=RssLanding&cat=news&id=1888917) at Stratford.  

Lendlease subsequently [sold the completed Olympic Village to Delancey](http://www.stratfordlondon.info/news/olympic-village-sold-qatari-diar-delancey-consortium), which has been managing it via a subsidiary company called.. which hasn't paid a penny in corporation tax. 

We are about to get into a fresh range of ‘consultations’ for several major developments, including that for the shopping centre, and will no doubt hear the usual claims about the benefits they will bring to the community - the developers have to secure vital planning approvals, after all. The first condition of planning approval should be that the developer will not suck all the financial reward, not just out of the Elephant, but out of the country.
