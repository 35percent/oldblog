Further research as a follow-up to our [previous blog post](/2014-04-15-the-elephants-new-ivory-towers/) has uncovered some unexpected connections between the Elephant & Castle and offshore tax havens. These are outlined as follows:

1. First and foremost, are the [Tribeca Square](/tribeca-square) and [shopping centre](/shopping-centre) developers Delancey DV4, whose dodgy offshore tax avoidance schemes are [well reported](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/PrivateEyeNo1311.pdf). Delancey has [registered its shopping centre site](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/LRDeeds_ShoppingCentre.pdf) using a shell company (Elephant & Castle Properties (BVI)) set up in the British Virgin Islands. Likewise, its neighbouring Tribeca Square development is [registered](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/LandRegistry_TribecaSquare.pdf) in the British Virgin Islands. Delancey is also now reported to be developing the LCC site, which well end up putting half the Elephant & Castle into the hands of a BVI based company that pays zero UK tax.

2. Strata Tower was developed and owned by a SPV(Special Purpose Vehicle) company [registered](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/RegisterTGL251176.pdf) on the Isle of Man. Some of the penthouses are also [registered](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/StrataPenthouseLRRegister.pdf) to a SPV holding company on the Isle of Man and an offshore company called 'Gamma Civic', which is [registered](/img/LRegister_strata_penthouse.pdf) in Mauritius. 

3. [O'Central](http://83cramptonstreet.co.uk/), [South Central](http://oakmayneproperties.com/oakmayne-properties/portfolio/south-central-east/) and [Eileen house](/eileen-house) are being developed by 'Oakmayne' - a [company](https://opencorporates.com/companies/im/113350C) based on the Isle of Man and which also [helps its customers](http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/dec/16/london-property-tax-avoidance-offshore) avoid stamp duty by setting up SPV's on the Isle to buy the finished flats.

Heygate developer Lend Lease's global corporate structure is too complex for us to see whether it shares its fellow developer's fondness of offshore companies. However, we have found that its development arm - Lend Lease Residential PLC [doesn't pay](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/lendleasefinancialreport.pdf) a penny in UK corporation tax. 

Last year Lend Lease UK's parent company in Australia [recorded](http://phx.corporate-ir.net/External.File?item=UGFyZW50SUQ9MjA0NTA3fENoaWxkSUQ9LTF8VHlwZT0z&t=1) an annual profit of over £300m.

Lend Lease has no inhibitions about profiting from public assets though. As well as the Heygate and ['One the Elephant'](http://www.35percent.org/2014-01-11-flogging-the-elephant) developments - both on public land - it was Lend Lease's development arm which [bought](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/millennium-dome-the-white-elephant-that-learnt-to-fly-8157301.html) the Millenium dome plus 150 acres of Greenwich Peninsula for the princely sum of just £1. It [built the Olympic Village](http://www.thelondonmagazine.co.uk/property-experts/expert-opinions/the-olympic-village.html) with the help of hundreds of millions in public funding, and has used more former public land for a [£1.3bn scheme](http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=186950&p=RssLanding&cat=news&id=1888917) at Stratford.  

We are about to get into a fresh range of ‘consultations’ for several major developments, including that for the shopping centre, and will no doubt hear the usual claims about the benefits they will bring to the community - the developers have to secure vital planning approvals, after all. The first condition of planning approval should be that the developer will not suck all the financial reward, not just out of the Elephant, but out of the country.
