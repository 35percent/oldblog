Five years ago today, we received Southwark Council's response to our 2015 complaint that affordable homes secured at planning stage weren't being delivered. 

Southwark's Director of Planning [responded](/img/Stage1response28Jan2016.pdf) to our complaint saying _‘Southwark Council has appropriate safeguards in place and has not failed in its duties .. therefore your compliant is not upheld"._

The story behind our complaint began in 2015, when [we discovered](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2015/jul/21/neo-bankside-how-richard-rogers-new-non-dom-accom-cut-out-the-poor) that a high-profile development in the north of the borough had only delivered 62 of the 94 social rented homes required by the planning approval.

Shortly afterwards, we were contacted by a resident living in a new development at Elephant & Castle who was confused about an affordable housing tenant pack put through his letterbox. He was concerned that a similar trick had been pulled by the developer of his building, as he was paying market rent for his flat. He asked if we knew how to find out if his flat was supposed to be one of the 11 affordable homes in the building and what implications that would have.

We told him that we had no way of knowing whether his home was one of the 11 affordable units and advised him to contact the Council.

It later [emerged](https://www.insidehousing.co.uk/insight/insight/the-court-battles-over-section-106-delivery--56141) that the housing association concerned had sold these and other affordable homes across the borough on the open market.

Concerned that there appeared to be no control over affordable housing delivery, we checked the Council's [choice-based letting system](https://www.southwarkhomesearch.org.uk/) and found homes approved as social rent being let at more than twice social rent levels.

We then took a closer look and by cross-checking planning committee reports with section 106 agreements, Land Registry information, the [GLA affordable housing outturn dataset](http://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/gla-affordable-housing-programme-outturn/resource/0c87e5dc-f1e9-4edf-b246-bef6b40a9ba3) and [CORE lettings data](https://core.communities.gov.uk/), we compiled a long (but by no means exhaustive) [list](http://35percent.org/img/section106_tenure_breaches.pdf) of 43 schemes with potential breaches in the provision of 902 social rented homes.

Five years on from our complaint Southwark Council STILL doesn't know how many of these 902 social rented homes have actually been delivered.

## The Ombudsman
Unsatisfied with the Council's seeming unwillingness to address the problem we referred our complaint to the Local Government Ombudsman.

In November 2016, the Ombudsman published a damning report showing that Southwark didn't actually have any procedures for monitoring the delivery of affordable housing.

![](http://35percent.org/img/LGOFinalDecisionSOR.png)

The Ombudsman directed Southwark to agree to introducing monitoring procedures and conduct an audit of all the section 106 affordable housing in the borough.

In late 2019, after three years of badgering the Council to publish the results of the audit, the Council published a spreadsheet, which it claims is an audit.

![](http://35percent.org/img/auditpage.png)

But actually it is just a list of planning approvals where affordable housing was supposedly secured by the Council. In some schemes the Council has received confirmation from a housing association that affordable housing was provided on site, but it doesn't list the number of affordable homes required in each scheme or the tenure required. It is therefore impossible to say if the affordable housing has been delivered according to the planning consent.

![](http://35percent.org/img/audit_extract.png)

More importantly, in over two thirds of the schemes, the audit shows that the Council still doesn’t know who the housing association is and whether any affordable housing has been provided at all.

For example, phase 1 of the Aylesbury estate is listed as being let by L&Q at affordable rent (i.e. up to 80% market rent) but the s106 agreement for this scheme requires social rent.

Similarly phase 1 of the Canada Water regeneration required at least 123 homes at social rent. The audit shows these all at being provided at affordable rent.

Similarly, the 553-home Tabard Square scheme (02/AP/0168) was approved with a requirement for at least 79 social rented units. These are being listed as having been provided by Horizon Housing Association as affordable rent.

## Show us the 5,462 social rented homes

The audit clearly hasn’t been conducted effectively. It remains impossible to know how much affordable housing has been delivered or whether it has been delivered under the tenure required by the section 106 agreement.
