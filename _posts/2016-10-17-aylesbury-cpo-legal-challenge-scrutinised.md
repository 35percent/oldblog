Last Monday evening, Southwark's Overview and Scrutiny Committee rejected calls for its decision to appeal against the government's refusal to grant it a CPO against Aylesbury leaseholders, after it heard that it was powerless to do so.

The [Aylesbury estate Leaseholders Group](http://halag.wordpress.com) staged a protest at the meeting, angered at the damning judgement that their equalities and human rights had been breached and Southwark's refusal to accept the judgement. 


Council's [decision](http://35percent.org/2016-09-26-council-appeals-aylesbury-cpo-decision/) to appeal the Secretary of State's [damning judgement](http://35percent.org/2016-09-18-aylesbury-compulsory-purchase-order-rejected/) that their equalities/human rights were being breached.

The leaseholders made a [written submission](https://halag.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/oscdeputation_10102016.pdf) and gave evidence to the Committee, arguing that the High Court challenge was uneccessary. Having been [accused](http://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/aylesbury-plan-face-scrutiny/) of 'holding the Council to ransom', the leaseholders pointed out that all they wanted was to remain homeowners in the borough. They reminded the Council of its like-for-like rehousing offer and its mysterious disappearance from the list of options available to them early on in the delivery of the present scheme (like-for-like being a simple swap for a similar size flat on a council estate elsewhere in the borough).  

Council members came up with some questionable excuses as to why the like-for-like policy was dropped and insisted the best course of action was to challenge the Secretary of State's decision and continue shortchanging leaseholders.

The committee also heard that the Council has spent a total of £200k on the Aylesbury CPO inquiry to date and that it estimates a further £50k is required in order to mount the High Court challenge. It was not able to give an estimate of costs it would become liable for should it lose the High Court battle and be forced to pay the Secretary of State's legal fees and court costs. 

It was confirmed to the meeting that the decision to mount the legal challenge was taken by its 'Director of Law & Democracy', Doreen Forrester-Brown (as reported in our [last blog](http://35percent.org/2016-10-10-aylesbury-cpo-challenge-called-in/)), therefore the Overview & Scrutiny Committee is powerless to refer the decision to democratically elected members, because it was a delegated officer decision in the first place. 

The most vocal member of the Scrutiny committee was Southwark's only Corbynite Councillor Paul Fleming, who instead of scrutinising the Council's decision to appeal against the Secretary of State, scrutinised the decision to call it in. Councillor Fleming is a [homeowner](http://35percent.org/img/LR_163MerrowSt.pdf) on the [privatised](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2006/jan/18/keyworkerhousing.communities) Octavia Hill estate, overlooking the Aylesbury. He is a ward Councillor for the Aylesbury estate, a [vehement proponent](http://pwfpwfpwf.blogspot.co.uk/2015/03/the-aylesbury-estate-utopia-when.html) of demolition and [describes himself](http://pwfpwfpwf.blogspot.co.uk/2016/06/why-i-have-no-choice-but-to-keepcorbyn.html) as both a Jacobite and a Corbynite, [publicly endorsing](http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/8825) Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership. He is also one of only two Labour Councillors in Southwark to have actively [campaigned for Brexit](http://pwfpwfpwf.blogspot.co.uk/2016/04/brexit-constructive-case-to-leave.html) (of the Lexit variety).
  
Cllr Fleming defended Doreen Forrester-Brown's decision to appeal, explaining that the Council's main [grounds](http://35percent.org/img/20161007_Secretary_of_State_Aylesbury_CPO.pdf) were that the Inspector failed to take into account the improvements the Council had made to its re-housing offer for leaseholders. What Councillor Fleming didn't explain is that these changes to leaseholder rehousing policy were made two months after the public inquiry had closed and that [inquiry rules](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2006/1838/pdfs/uksi_20061838_en.pdf) state that new evidence cannot be submitted by either party after a public inquiry has closed. Councillor Fleming also dismissed the leaseholders' request for like-for-like swaps as 'privatising council housing'.

The second of the Council's two arguments listed in its [grounds of appeal](http://35percent.org/img/20161007_Secretary_of_State_Aylesbury_CPO.pdf) to the High Court, is that it claims none of the objectors at the inquiry raised the issue of overshadowing. A cursory glance through the witness evidence shows that the Council's claim is incorrect. Overshadowing was indeed raised by at least one of the objectors Piers Corbyn, former ward Councillor for the Aylesbury estate. Here is the audio clip of Piers raising the overshadowing issue (amongst others).

In addition, the inspector was provided with full copies of all the objections received by the Council to the planning application, several of which raised the issue of overshadowing. We have drafted full responses to the Council's grounds of appeal in [a letter](http://35percent.org/img/SoSletter17102016.pdf) we have sent to the Secretary of State as an interested party in the appeal case.

Aylesbury leaseholders and their supporters have already received 'letters before claim' (dated 3 days before the Scrutiny Committee meeting) formally notifying them of Southwark's intention to challenge the CPO decision. Campaigners are therefore gearing up to give the greatest possible support to the leaseholders. Southwark's panicked response to the CPO decision is a desperate attempt to rescue a regeneration scheme whose viability rests on a breach of human rights and shortchanging leaseholders. Southwark's and Notting Hill Housing Trust's entire strategy is based on a cheap method of dispossessing residents. With 250 leaseholders remaining on the Aylesbury estate and thousands more on estates across the borough, the outcome of this case is likely to have implications for regeneration schemes in years to come. 

A [legal opinion](http://hsfnotes.com/realestatedevelopment/2016/09/28/a-new-right-to-a-community-decision-by-the-secretary-of-state-not-to-confirm-the-cpo-for-aylesbury-estate/) says that this decision could herald a possible new 'right to a community' for council estate residents, a right that is sorely needed. We have now set up a [crowdfunding campaign](https://www.gofundme.com/aylesbury-the-right-to-a-community-2uefgf2s) to pay for a barrister to represent the objectors at Southwark's appeal hearing. Any contribution that you can make to this fund, small or large, will help both the Aylesbury leaseholders and be a step towards making the 'right to a community' a reality.
