The Aylesbury CPO decision has taken a further twist - Southwark Council's Overview and Scrutiny Committee has 'called-in' the decision for further examination, which it will scrutinise on Monday evening.
The Committee only has the power to refer the decision back to Cabinet or the full Council Assembly for reconsideration. Given the political majorities in these bodies, it is very unlikely that the decision to appeal will be reversed. However, the OSC action shows the levels of disquiet at Southwark's behaviour. Aylesbury leaseholders are due to give evidience to the Committee. The Committee has been briefed on the decision to seek leave for the appeal by Southwark's __'Director of Law Democracy'__- Doreen Forrester-Brown and her report has several interesting points. First, it seems that the report to the Cabinet meeting that took the decision to appeal was wrong in one important respect; one 'Recommendation 2(d)' led the Committee to think that deciding to appeal was a matter for the Council; in fact the Cabinet was misinformed and instead it is a decision for someone called the 'Monitoring Officer'.

The briefing states _'All matters not reserved to Council Assembly, Cabinet or for a committee for decision are delegated to the appropriate chief officer and/or head of service'_ and _'there is no requirement for Cabinet to take this decision'_. So it appears that the decision to appeal against the refusal of the CPO is in fact not in the hands of our democratically elected members but in the hands of an un-elected senior officer.

Second, having employed one QC to lose them this case, Southwark has decided now to employ one more QC in their effort to reverse the decision. So good news for the highly-paid legal profession, bad news for the hard-pressed Southwark Council tax payer.

Third, the future of the Aylesbury regeneration is now indeed in doubt. The briefing says if the Secretary of State's decision is not overturned then _'it undoubtedly indicates a shift in focus that will be hugely difficult to accommodate within the context of scheme viability and deliverability'_ - in simple language, Southwark won't be able to deliver the estate's regeneration if it has to pay leaseholders fair compensation for the loss of their homes.

The Council's desperation is such that it has been led to [accuse](http://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/aylesbury-plan-face-scrutiny/) leaseholders of holding it to ransom. It says that _'they are being offered market value plus ten percent'_ but we have shown the kind of dirty tricks it gets up to in, such as using a one bedroom flat illegaly converted in four bedrooms as a point of comparison. These tricks have resulted in valuations of £187 for a 1-bed

## The Right to Remain
Beyond the leaseholders, the decision looks as if it could benefit all regeneration estate residents. In an opinion from Herbert Smith Freehills

>"the decision raises the weight to be given to residents' expectations that they will be able to remain in their community. This falls short of an absolute "right to a community", but will clearly be a significant factor in future CPO decisions."

## Conclusion
The Aylesbury regeneration is at the end of the day a commercial development with the aim of building 1700 private homes to gain Notting Hill Housing £163m in profit. Southwark's part of the deal is to spend nearly £150m[^1] of public money and to demolish 2,249 council houses with [no adequate] replacement affordable housing. To any objective observer all this makes no sense.

As we said in our last blog, Southwark should take this opportunity to call a halt to this misconceived regeneration and abandon what could be its futile and costly attempt to overturn the Secretary of State's decision.
