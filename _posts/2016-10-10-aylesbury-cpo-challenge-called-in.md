The Aylesbury CPO decision took a further twist this week when Southwark Council's [Overview and Scrutiny Committee](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/mgCommitteeDetails.aspx?ID=308) 'called-in' the decision for further examination, which it will [scrutinise on Monday evening](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=308&MId=5456&Ver=4).

The committee only has the power to refer the decision back to Cabinet or Council Assembly for reconsideration and given the political majorities in these bodies, it is very unlikely that the decision to appeal will be reversed. However, the call-in shows the levels of disquiet at Southwark's behaviour. The [Aylesbury Leaseholders Group](http://halag.wordpress.com) is also due to give evidience at the Scrutiny Committee meeting.

The committee has been briefed on the decision to seek leave for the appeal by Southwark's __'Director of Law Democracy'__- Doreen Forrester-Brown and her [briefing report](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s64406/Briefing%20Paper%20OSC%20101016%202.pdf) has several interesting points. 

First it seems that the advice given [report](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s64034/Report%20Aylesbury%20Delivery%20supplemental%20report.pdf) to the Cabinet meeting that took the decision to appeal was wrong in one important respect; 'Recommendation 2(d)' of the [report](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s64034/Report%20Aylesbury%20Delivery%20supplemental%20report.pdf) misled the Cabinet committee to think that deciding to appeal was a matter for the Council; in fact the Cabinet was misinformed and instead it is a decision for someone called the 'Monitoring Officer' (see para 11 of the [Doreen Forrester-Brown's briefing](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s64406/Briefing%20Paper%20OSC%20101016%202.pdf)).

The briefing report goes on to state _'All matters not reserved to Council Assembly, Cabinet or for a committee for decision are delegated to the appropriate chief officer and/or head of service'_ and _'there was no requirement for Cabinet to take this decision'_ (paras 13 & 15). So it appears that the decision to appeal against the refusal of the CPO is in fact not in the hands of our democratically elected members but in the hands of an unelected senior officer.

Second, having employed one QC, who lost them the case, Southwark has decided it needs to double-up and employ a second QC _'of appropriate experience'_ in its effort to reverse the decision. So it's good news for [FTB Chambers](https://www.ftbchambers.co.uk/barristers/melissa-murphy) and others in the highly-paid legal profession and bad news for the hard-pressed Southwark Council tax payer.

Third, the future of the Aylesbury regeneration is now indeed in doubt. The briefing says that if the Secretary of State's decision is not overturned then _'it undoubtedly indicates a shift in focus that will be hugely difficult to accommodate within the context of scheme viability and deliverability'_ - in simple language, Southwark won't be able to deliver the estate's regeneration if it has to pay leaseholders fair compensation for the loss of their homes.

## Desperate measures
The Council's desperation is such that it has been led to [accuse](http://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/aylesbury-plan-face-scrutiny/) leaseholders of holding it to ransom. It says that _'they are being offered market value plus ten percent'_, but we have shown the kind of dirty tricks it gets up to in its determination of market value, such as [using a one bedroom flat illegaly converted in four bedrooms as a comparison](http://35percent.org/2014-05-16-southwark-gives-green-light-to-slum-landlords/). These tricks have resulted in the Council getting away with making valuations as low as [£75k for a 1-bed flat in 2012](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/sep/20/aylesbury-estate-ruling-future-regeneration-sajid-javid).

## The Right to Remain
A number of law firms have published legal opinions on the Aylesbury CPO decision.  In [this opinion](http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=7d876b71-cdee-48a9-ad05-240a210b0d82) from  [Herbert Smith Freehills](https://www.herbertsmithfreehills.com/) the decision is heralded as a possible future 'right to remain' for council estate residents:

Herbert Smith Freehills are Southwark's [legal advisors](https://web.archive.org/web/20160316171355/http://www.herbertsmithfreehills.com/news/news20100810-hs-advises-the-london-borough-of-southwark-on-elephant-and-castle-regeneration) for the Elephant & Castle regeneration, so Southwark should pay them  particular heed.

[Another opinion](http://mypreferences.ashurst.com/reaction/PDF/CPOmailing.pdf) is from leading law firm [Ashurst](https://www.ashurst.com) and is listed in Doreen Forrester-Brown's briefing, but, given Southwark's decision to appeal, the following paragraph appears to have been entirely ignored:

Both the manner in which Southwark has decided to appeal agains the CPO decision and the decision itself begs some questions - who took the decision, the Cabinet or the mysterious Monitoring officer?  Why was the decision to appeal take when at least one piece of advice rates it chances of success so low?  Any contrary legal advice, which says the appeal can succeed should be made public.  We think the Council should also say 
*How much did it spend on the Aylesbury Compulsory Purchase Order proceedings?
*How much does it expect to spend on its high court challenge of the Secretary of State's decision?

## Conclusion
The Aylesbury regeneration is essentially a commercial development with the aim of building 1773 private homes to make Notting Hill Housing £163m in profit. Southwark's part of the deal is to spend nearly £150m[^1] of public money and to demolish 2,249 council houses with [no adequate] replacement affordable housing. To any objective observer none of this can make any sense.

As we said in our last blog, Southwark should take this opportunity to call a halt to this misconceived regeneration and abandon what could be its futile and costly attempt to overturn the Secretary of State's decision. 


__Footnotes:__

[^1]: Pararaph 17 of [this 2014 Council report](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s52089/Report) states that the Council expects to spend at least £150m decanting and demolishing the estate. However, the Council has [already committed £99m](http://35percent.org/2016-09-26-council-appeals-aylesbury-cpo-decision/#the-business-case-for-a-moratorium) of this before the first development site has even been demolished, so it is expected that this figure will be greatly exceeded.
