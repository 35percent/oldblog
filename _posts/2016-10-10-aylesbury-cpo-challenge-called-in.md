The Aylesbury CPO decision has taken a further twist - Southwark Council's Overview and Scrutiny Committee has 'called-in' the decision for further examination, which it will scrutinise on Monday evening.
The Committee only has the power to refer the decision back to Cabinet or the full Council Assembly for reconsideration. Given the political majorities in these bodies, it is very unlikely that the decision to appeal will be reversed. However, the OSC action shows the levels of disquiet at Southwark's behaviour. Aylesbury leaseholders are due to give evidience to the Committee. The Committee has been briefed on the decision to seek leave for the appeal by Southwark's __'Director of Law Democracy'__- Doreen Forrester-Brown and her [briefing report](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s64406/Briefing%20Paper%20OSC%20101016%202.pdf) has several interesting points. 

First, just when you thought that there couldn't be any more blunders by Southwark, it seems that the [report](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s64034/Report%20Aylesbury%20Delivery%20supplemental%20report.pdf) to the Cabinet meeting that took the decision to appeal was wrong in one important respect; 'Recommendation 2(d)' of the [report](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s64034/Report%20Aylesbury%20Delivery%20supplemental%20report.pdf) led the Cabinet committee to think that deciding to appeal was a matter for the Council; in fact the Cabinet was misinformed and instead it is a decision for someone called the 'Monitoring Officer' (see para 11 of the [Doreen Forrester-Brown's briefing](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s64406/Briefing%20Paper%20OSC%20101016%202.pdf) .

The briefing report goes on to state _'All matters not reserved to Council Assembly, Cabinet or for a committee for decision are delegated to the appropriate chief officer and/or head of service'_ and _'there was no requirement for Cabinet to take this decision'_ (paras 13 & 15). So it appears that the decision to appeal against the refusal of the CPO is in fact not in the hands of our democratically elected members but in the hands of an unelected senior officer.

Second, having employed one QC to lose them this case, Southwark has decided now to employ an additional QC _'of appropriate experience'_ in its effort to reverse the decision. So it's good news for the highly-paid legal profession and bad news for the hard-pressed Southwark Council tax payer.

Third, the future of the Aylesbury regeneration is now indeed in doubt. The briefing says if the Secretary of State's decision is not overturned then _'it undoubtedly indicates a shift in focus that will be hugely difficult to accommodate within the context of scheme viability and deliverability'_ - in simple language, Southwark won't be able to deliver the estate's regeneration if it has to pay leaseholders fair compensation for the loss of their homes.

## Desperate measures
The Council's desperation is such that it has been led to [accuse](http://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/aylesbury-plan-face-scrutiny/) leaseholders of holding it to ransom. It says that _'they are being offered market value plus ten percent'_ but we have shown the kind of dirty tricks it gets up to in its determination of market value, such as [using a one bedroom flat illegaly converted in four bedrooms as a comparison](http://35percent.org/2014-05-16-southwark-gives-green-light-to-slum-landlords/). These tricks have resulted in valuations as low as [£75k for a 1-bed flat](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/sep/20/aylesbury-estate-ruling-future-regeneration-sajid-javid).

## The Right to Remain
Beyond the leaseholders, the decision looks as if it could benefit all regeneration estate residents. In [an opinion](http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=7d876b71-cdee-48a9-ad05-240a210b0d82) from legal experts [Herbert Smith Freehills](https://www.herbertsmithfreehills.com/).

## Conclusion
The Aylesbury regeneration is at the end of the day a commercial development with the aim of building 1773 private homes to gain Notting Hill Housing £163m in profit. Southwark's part of the deal is to spend nearly £150m[^1] of public money and to demolish 2,249 council houses with [no adequate] replacement affordable housing. To any objective observer all this makes no sense.

As we said in our last blog, Southwark should take this opportunity to call a halt to this misconceived regeneration and abandon what could be its futile and costly attempt to overturn the Secretary of State's decision. 


__Footnotes:__

[^1]: Pararaph 17 of [this 2014 Council report](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s52089/Report) states that the Council expects to spend at least £150m decanting and demolishing the estate. However, the Council has [already committed £99m](http://35percent.org/2016-09-26-council-appeals-aylesbury-cpo-decision/#the-business-case-for-a-moratorium) of this before the first development site has even been demolished, so it is expected that this figure will be greatly exceeded.
