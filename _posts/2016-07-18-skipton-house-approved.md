The mixed-used re-development of Skipton House (link previous 35% blog) was approved by Southwark Council’s planning committee (link Officer’s Report) last Tuesday. It will have 408 new homes with an average price of £820,000 (Link/Note). There will be no affordable housing.

Instead developer London &amp; Regional Properties Ltd (Link) will build, or have built, 89 affordable homes elsewhere, off-site, at a cost of £16.88m – just 2% of the total development value of £745m. Developer profit is ‘assumed’ to be £75m (Link FVA Executive Summary).

## L&amp;R hits the jackpot
This is a win on many counts for London &amp; Regional (L&amp;R). It avoids building the full 35%affordable housing required by local policy, at a loss to the community of over 50 affordable homes. It avoids sullying the purity of its 100% private development, allowing L&amp;R to sell them at premium prices. It avoids paying a larger in-lieu payment of £27.3m, if it had to pay for 89 units, rather than not build them itself. This in –lieu payment would have increased to £47.8m had Southwark charged for the full 35% affordable housing L&amp;R were liable to provide. L&amp;R has hit the jackpot.

## Off-site affordable housing - who knows where, who knows when
The sites for the 89 off-site units L&amp;R are committed to build are pencilled-in for Salisbury Close, Manor Place and Braganza St (Link? Footnote?), but no planning approvals have been
secured and while applications are anticipated before the end of the year, Southwark’s planning officers made it clear that the homes could be built elsewhere (Peckham and Camberwell were mentioned). It could also take a while before they are built – the delivery of affordable housing will be ‘dovetailed’ with the Skipton House redevelopment, but L&amp;R have been allowed a generous 5 years to get their scheme off the ground, instead of the customary three years.

## Only £16m for affordable housing
L&amp;R achieved this stunning victory for profit over the affordable housing by successfully arguing that there was only £16m in the kitty for affordable housing and if they paid anything more their development would be rendered unviable. It was able to pull this off, in part, because it had bought Skipton House for £54.5m in 2001 (Link, Land Registry doc) and then sat on it, while land values rose, allowing it to enter a figure of £120m as Skipton House’s value into a viability assessment. This was the bulk of a £137m valuation of the whole site, raising the benchmark measure for viable development and leaving lots less for affordable housing.

## £16m versus £67
While L&amp;R said that only a maximum of £16m was available for affordable housing, Southwark’s expert consultants came up with a much higher maximum figure - £67m. (Link/footnote Officer’s report para 77, 78). However, the planning committee was easily persuaded to settle for the lower figure by the promise of a viability review, after development has started, which might get further payments for affordable housing, if, amongst other things, residential and office values rose and building costs fell.

## Abject Labour
The Labour members voted as a block in favour of the development. The Lib Dem councillors Adele Morris and Hamish McCulloch voted against. Local Cathedral ward councillor David Noakes also spoke against the application.

## The result…
Skipton House joins a shameful list of developments at the Elephant, approved by Southwark, but without affordable housing, or without social rented housing – Tribeca Sq, One the Elephant, Strata Tower, 360 Tower, Eileen House (Link – 35% Blog ‘Towers of Shame’).

Skipton House shows why Southwark is in the bottom 3 London boroughs for affordable housing delivery (Link – 35% blog). It is gullible and weak in the face of property developers and, in despite of its much-vaunted ‘we will build 11,000 council homes’ boast (Link), building affordable housing is its lowest priority.
