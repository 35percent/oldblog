subtitle: Lendlease fails to declare public funding for affordable housing

Developer Lendlease failed to disclose that it was in receipt of public funding that could have increased the amount of affordable housing on Elephant Park, at a Southwark planning committee meeting last Tuesday.

The meeting was called because of the large number of objections to the final phase, H7 MP5, and the lack of additional affordable housing, despite an increase in the total number of homes.  Lendlease are obliged to provide 25% affordable housing, and to improve this, up to the 35% policy requirement

One of the objections, from the 35% Campaign, was that _"There appears to have been no effort to take advantage of any public funding"_.  Southwark responded  by saying: _"There is no obligation on Lendlease to seek public funds."_ (para 282, 283 of the [officer's report](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s87381/Report%20Plot%20H7%20Heygate%20Street%20within%20land%20bounded%20by%20Elephant%20Park%20to%20the%20north%20Plot%20H2%20to%20the%20wes.pdf))

The planning committee followed this up in their cross examination of Lendlease, who were asked directly by Cllr King whether they had considered applying for grant funding.

In a lengthy reply, Lendlease did not disclose that the Mayor had in fact committed to fund Elephant Park, back in September 2018. 

Elephant Park is the very first entry on a [list] of (https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/31.07.19_for_website_-_estate_regen_projects_approved_after_18_july_2018.pdf) estate regeneration projects where the Mayor has approved funding since July 2018.

This gives rise to a number of questions:

1. Why did Lendlease not say that they had received funding when the question was asked?

2. Why were the committee members not told that Lendlease has received funding in the committee report?

3. How much money has Lendlease received from the Mayor?

4. Why has the affordable housing offer not been improved?

We suspect that the answer to this lies in the murky world of viability; Lendlease insisted in 2013 that only 9.4% of the new homes could be viably provided as affordable.

They repeated this at the planning committee meeting last week and will no doubt argue that any money they have received from the Mayor has gone to bridging the gap between what is viable and the 25% being delivered.

Whatever the merits of this argument (and we think it has none) it still leaves open the question of why Lendlease and the [officers report](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s87381/Report%20Plot%20H7%20Heygate%20Street%20within%20land%20bounded%20by%20Elephant%20Park%20to%20the%20north%20Plot%20H2%20to%20the%20wes.pdf) did not disclose the grant funding to members. 

There is a similarity here to the ongoing dispute about affordable housing in the shopping centre development. Developer Delancey claim that the Â£11.24m it is also receiving from the Mayor is being used to increase the amount of social rented housing. We [showed previously](http://35percent.org/2018-07-02-viability-and-delancey/) how it was going to Delancey's bottom line:
