## A New Post


## Response to Mayor's viabilty SPG
Mayor's new viability SPG is piss poor and full of ready-made get-out clauses for developers, particulary around land value. 
Sadiq Khan has completed Boris's unfinished goal of peverting the term 'affordable housing'.

Diffrent Mayor; business as usual.

Plus ca change, plus c'est la meme chose.

Here's our [detailed response](https://justspacelondon.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/affordable-hsg-spg-35-response-draft.pdf) as if it mattered..

## Response to Mayor's estate regeneration guidance
Mayor's estate regeneration guidance is equally piss poor.

Not even the requirement for a ballot.
In contrast, it actually recommends to avoiding ballots!

Here's our [detailed response](link) as if were going to have any impact anyway..

What a complete cop out etc.

Boo to all those lefty academics who recommended we vote for Sadiq Khan..
