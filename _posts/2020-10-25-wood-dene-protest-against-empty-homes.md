[People Before Profit](https://m.facebook.com/peoplebeforeprofitCVD19/) and [Southwark Defend Council Housing](https://m.facebook.com/southwarkdch/) (SDCH) are mounting a protest against empty homes in Southwark with a [demonstration at Peckham Place 12pm Saturday the 31 October](https://m.facebook.com/events/3120862284692741?acontext=%7B%22action_history%22%3A%5B%7B%22surface%22%3A%22page%22%2C%22mechanism%22%3A%22page_admin_bar%22%2C%22extra_data%22%3A%22%7B%5C%22page_id%5C%22%3A839272879439624%7D%22%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22events_admin_tool%22%2C%22mechanism%22%3A%22events_admin_tool%22%2C%22extra_data%22%3A%22%5B%5D%22%7D%5D%2C%22has_source%22%3Atrue%7D).

The demo is to highlight the number of empty homes in the borough and takes place at a critical time for London’s homeless people, who enjoyed some respite from their plight during the Covid lockdown, when they were housed in the capital’s empty hotels.  Charities  are warning [homeless people's lives](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-54458884) will be lost this winter unless action is taken.

[People before Profit](https://m.facebook.com/peoplebeforeprofitCVD19/) and [SDCH](https://m.facebook.com/southwarkdch/) are demanding that empty homes are requisitioned for the homeless.  It will be the third demo highlighting the issue, after demos at Maydew House and Elephant Park, formerly the Heygate estate - see [#RequistionEmptyHomes](https://twitter.com/hashtag/RequisitionEmptyHomes?src=hash).

## Wood Dene council homes that were lost

The new Peckham Place development, replaced the Wood Dene estate [which had 323 council homes](http://35percent.org/wood-dene-regeneration/), before it [was demolished in 2007](https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/notting-hill-admits-wood-dene-estate-peckham-wont-rebuilt-2019-thirteen-years-demolition/) as part of the [Southwark Estates Initiative](http://embed.verite.co/timeline/?source=0Aprl6XcACewydEhRaWFOLVBfUjBSVW1HUGVZNEhGeFE&font=Bevan-PotanoSans&maptype=toner&lang=en&hash_bookmark=true&start_zoom_adjust=2&height=650#1), a regeneration strategy devised by Southwark Council’s as part of New Labour’s ‘Urban Task Force’ renewal strategy.  None of the council homes have been replaced.

Peckham Place has had a tortuous development history, [related on our Wood Dene regeneration webpage](http://35percent.org/wood-dene-regeneration/).  Southwark decided to [demolish Wood Dene back in 2000](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/Data/Executive/20030729/Agenda/56 - Disposal of 216-224Underhill Road, SE22.pdf) and the Presentation housing association were adopted by Southwark as the site’s developer [in 2002](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/Data/Executive/20050523/Agenda/Item 11 - Wooddene EstateRegeneration - Update.pdf) [^1].  In 2005 Presentation’s ‘preferred’ proposal was for a development of 216 units, half to be social rented, half to be intermediate (para 13) ^2.  But Presentation were taken over by Notting Housing Trust (NHHT) in 2009 and it was NHHT who eventually secured planning permission for the redevelopment, in 2013.
