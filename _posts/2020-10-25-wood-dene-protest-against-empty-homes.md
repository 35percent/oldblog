[People Before Profit](https://m.facebook.com/peoplebeforeprofitCVD19/) and [Southwark Defend Council Housing](https://m.facebook.com/southwarkdch/) (SDCH) are mounting a protest against empty homes in Southwark with a [demonstration at Peckham Place 12pm Saturday the 31 October](https://m.facebook.com/events/3120862284692741?acontext=%7B%22action_history%22%3A%5B%7B%22surface%22%3A%22page%22%2C%22mechanism%22%3A%22page_admin_bar%22%2C%22extra_data%22%3A%22%7B%5C%22page_id%5C%22%3A839272879439624%7D%22%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22events_admin_tool%22%2C%22mechanism%22%3A%22events_admin_tool%22%2C%22extra_data%22%3A%22%5B%5D%22%7D%5D%2C%22has_source%22%3Atrue%7D).

The demo is to highlight the number of empty homes in the borough and takes place at a critical time for London’s homeless people, who enjoyed some respite from their plight during the Covid lockdown, when they were housed in the capital’s empty hotels.  Charities  are warning [homeless people's lives](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-54458884) will be lost this winter unless action is taken.

[People before Profit](https://m.facebook.com/peoplebeforeprofitCVD19/) and [SDCH](https://m.facebook.com/southwarkdch/) are demanding that empty homes are requisitioned for the homeless.  It will be the third demo highlighting the issue, after demos at Maydew House and Elephant Park, formerly the Heygate estate - see [#RequistionEmptyHomes](https://twitter.com/hashtag/RequisitionEmptyHomes?src=hash).

## Wood Dene council homes that were lost

The new Peckham Place development, replaced the Wood Dene estate [which had 323 council homes](http://35percent.org/wood-dene-regeneration/), before it [was demolished in 2007](https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/notting-hill-admits-wood-dene-estate-peckham-wont-rebuilt-2019-thirteen-years-demolition/) as part of the [Southwark Estates Initiative](http://embed.verite.co/timeline/?source=0Aprl6XcACewydEhRaWFOLVBfUjBSVW1HUGVZNEhGeFE&font=Bevan-PotanoSans&maptype=toner&lang=en&hash_bookmark=true&start_zoom_adjust=2&height=650#1), a regeneration strategy devised by Southwark Council’s as part of New Labour’s ‘Urban Task Force’ renewal strategy.  None of the council homes have been replaced.

Peckham Place has had a tortuous development history, [related on our Wood Dene regeneration webpage](http://35percent.org/wood-dene-regeneration/).  Southwark decided to [demolish Wood Dene back in 2000](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/Data/Executive/20030729/Agenda/56%20-%20Disposal%20of%20216-224Underhill%20Road,%20SE22.pdf) and the Presentation housing association were adopted by Southwark as the site’s developer [in 2002](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/Data/Executive/20050523/Agenda/Item%2011%20-%20Wooddene%20EstateRegeneration%20-%20Update.pdf) [^1].  In 2005 Presentation’s ‘preferred’ proposal was for [a development of 216 units](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/Data/Executive/20050523/Agenda/Item%2011%20-%20Wooddene%20EstateRegeneration%20-%20Update.pdf), half to be social rented, half to be intermediate [^2]  But Presentation were taken over by Notting Housing Trust (NHHT) in 2009 and it was NHHT who eventually secured planning permission for the redevelopment, in 2013.

Despite being a housing association, NHHT produced a viability assessment that claimed that only 63 shared ownership and 54 social rent units could be built (alongside 216 private units) – a net loss of 197 affordable homes [according to the GLA](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!gC0r1MnWVfiWgymHTtPApA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) [^3], compared to the council homes on Wood Dene.  By the time Peckham Place was completed in late 2019, there were 54 ‘affordable rent’,  and 201 homes for shared ownership, [according to an onsite billboard](http://35percent.org/wood-dene-regeneration/), leaving [78 for private sale](https://www.nhg.org.uk/building-homes/developments/wooddene-estate-southwark/).

## What happened to the Wood Dene residents?

Southwark [stopped issuing secure council tenancies](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/Data/Executive/20050523/Agenda/Item%2011%20-%20Wooddene%20EstateRegeneration%20-%20Update.pdf) on Wood Dene in May 2002, but there were [289 households to be decanted](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/Data/Executive/20030729/Agenda/56%20-%20Disposal%20of%20216-224Underhill%20Road,%20SE22.pdf) in July 2003 (para 19), with 173 wishing to return to new homes on the redeveloped estate [^4]. Given that the work on the new homes [did not begin until 2016](https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/notting-hill-admits-wood-dene-estate-peckham-wont-rebuilt-2019-thirteen-years-demolition/), it seems that they were all bound to have been disappointed, despite a pledge that they would have a [‘right to return’](http://35percent.org/wood-dene-regeneration/).   All but the 16 leaseholders would have been rehoused in current council housing stock, as long as they were secure tenants, not temporary tenants filling the voids created since May 2002.

Leaseholders would have received compensation for their homes at ‘market value’, but as [leaseholders at the Heygate and Aylesbury estates](https://crappistmartin.github.io/blog/2014/05/30/aylesbury-leaseholder-fights-incestuous-valuation/) found, it would not be sufficient for a free-market homes in the area, let alone anything on Peckham Place, where a two-bed home [costs between £585k and £700k](https://www.nhgsales.com/sales-developments/peckham-place/#availability).

The cost of decanting the residents was [estimated in 2003 to be £879,750](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/Data/Executive/20030729/Agenda/56%20-%20Disposal%20of%20216-224Underhill%20Road,%20SE22.pdf para 24), made up of home loss, and disturbance payments and leasehold acquisition [^5].
