While fuelling the housing crisis by [demolishing](http://35percent.org/the-southwark-clearances/) or [selling off](http://35percent.org/auctions/#selling-southwarks-adult-care-services) thousands of council homes our Council members have been investing their pensions in real estate funds and cashing in on the housing crisis.

According to its most recent [pension fund annual report](http://www.2.southwark.gov.uk/downloads/download/2717/pension_fund_annual_report), of the £12.7m Southwark Council received in returns on its pension fund, £9.3m was from UK property investments.

The report shows that the Council has invested in a staggering £xxm of commercial and residential property, which it lets out to provide income for its pension fund.

## Direct landlord
The Council owns a portfolio of commercial and residential property in London and the wider UK. One of these is an office block called 'Hope House' near Millbank in Westminster.

In 2014, Southwark Council [applied](http://idoxpa.westminster.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=documents&keyVal=NH2VAHRP0C400) to Westminster Council under the new Permitted Development Rights to convert the office block into residential units. (ref: 14/12753/FULL)

It claimed that it wouldn't be financially viable to provide any affordable housing and submitted a viability assessment to support its claim.

Find out who the residential units are currently let to and for how much - airBNB?

## PRS Sector
One of the real estate funds it has invested in specialises in PRS developments in London https://www.invescoperpetual.co.uk/site/ip/pdf/Invesco-UK-residential-market-whitepaper.pdf

These Council [meeting minutes](/img/Minutes_21_April_2015.pdf) show that there is concern about investing in PRS.

Look at the other funds to see if anything linked directly to Southwark.
