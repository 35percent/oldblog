## The contractual agreement

Southwark Council is BL's development partner in this scheme.  Southwark Council is the freehold owner of the Print Works and the Surrey Quays shopping centre (for which it collects £400k p.a. in rent and 5% of turnover respectively[^1]) and under a  Master Development Agreement (MDA)has a  20% interest in the site's development.

There is a lengthy and detailed [contractual agreement](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/regeneration/canada-water?chapter=6) between the parties that was signed over a year ago.  Unfortunately, the [Affordable housing section](https://docdro.id/LfnPTM2) of the partnership agreement between Southwark and development partner British Land has been completely redacted.

## Replacement leisure centre
The planning committee report makes much of the brand new leisure centre that will be provided as part of the scheme. What it doesn't emphasise is that the existing Seven Islands leisure centre will be demolished and the replacement centre will have a smaller swimming pool. Neither does it mention that the Council will be funding the construction of the new leisure centre (up to a cap of £35m).

## Retailers booted out
Sounds familiar (E&C shopping centre).
Tesco has [objected](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!mfBPS4FpNyvJIYiLezGjrA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) to the planning application, arguing that the planning committee report misrepresents its current position.
