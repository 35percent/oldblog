Masterman House - scheme costs = £11.6m

If the 10 private units sell for £500k each then the net cost of the 15 'social rent' units is £433k each!!

Not good value for money considering that council homes on the Aylesbury can be refurbished for £35k per dwelling.




Kipling estate - £350 per dwelling:
