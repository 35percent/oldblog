title: Government to allow developers to 'defer' affordable housing

## New Coronavirus guidance threatens affordable housing delivery

While the Coronavirus crisis has highlighted the desperate need for more affordable housing (cite homeless figures, rough sleeping, hotel use, overcrowding), the government is moving housebuilding in the other direction, with new guidance to councils, that encourages developers to delay the delivery of affordable housing.

The guidance, issued last week, is called [Coronavirus (COVID-19) – Community Infrastructure Levy guidance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-community-infrastructure-levy-guidance) and advises local councils and other authorities to ........ It has done this to help small and medium size (SME) developers through the coronvirus crisis and the inevitable economic aftermath

Community In frastructure Levy (CiL) and s106 payments are used to....fund affordable housing and other benefits.

## What will impact be?

The guidance is aimed at small and medium developers, who are defined as having turnovers of less than £45m per annum.  Likely contenders/possibilities - Civic Centre [Civic Centre Limited](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/09903430/filing-history), [Shaviram Developments Limited](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/09569986/filing-history)
 and [Old Kent Road Regeneration Limited](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/11330498/filing-history); Ruby Triangle [Ruby Triangle Ltd](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/10733947/filing-history)

Old Kent Rd developments - many technically non-viable already; doubts over Bakerloo Line

Housing sector reaction - Inside Housing

Delancey is a private company and the ‘advisor’ on the shopping centre development. The ‘developer’ is two companies  - Elephant and Castle Properties Co Ltd and Elephant and Castle Properties Ltd. The investors are APG, a Dutch pension fund;  Quatar Diar, a sovereign wealth fund and DOOR, a partnership which includes a Canadian municipal employees pension fund. The scheme itself will cost £900m (Cabinet report 23 March item 24).

So, the shopping centre is clearly not a SME development.  However, if the definition of an SME is a body with a turnover of less than £45m, then Elephant and Castle Properties Ltd qualifies (2018/19 turnover £2.96m), as does its parent company Elephant and Castle LLP (2018/19 turnover £5.67m).  Elephant and Castle Co Ltd is listed in the British Virgin Islands, so we do not know what its turnover is. 

Most major developers set up separate companies for separate developments, so might take advantage of the SME definition, to defer CiL/s106 obligations.  The government says it will be publishing amendments to the regulations – aside from an outright objection to the idea, this would be an area councils should make representations on.
