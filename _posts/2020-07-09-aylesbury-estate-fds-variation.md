Yesterday, Southwark Councillors took to twitter to announce an increase in the number of social rented homes to be provided on the first phase of the Aylesbury estate regeneration.

What the tweets didn't say is these 219 extra social rented homes will cost the Council an estimated £211 million pounds - that's £964k each.

Neither did they explain that Southwark has also agreed to let NHG continue to deliver the xxx private homes on this site - the revenue from which was supposed to cross-subsidise the social units.   

Neither did they explain that a proportion of these social rented units won't be social rented at all, because they will be used to rehouse leaseholders being decanted from later phases under the Council's [shared equity scheme.](

## History repeats
Rolled over twice already to NHG as it has used its viability clause negotiated in the DPA as leverage.

2. In September 2016, Southwark [forked out £21 million](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s63817/Report.Aylesbury%20Regeneration%20Delivery.pdf) in demolition and planning costs.

## The FDS 
In August last year, NHG was [forced](https://www.insidehousing.co.uk/news/news/notting-hill-genesis-scales-back-development-plans-amid-changing-market-conditions-62506) to 'significantly scale back' its development pipeline as it emerged that there were more than 400 unsold private market homes sitting on its books.

## 11,000 new Council homes
We blogged previously about Southwark's flagging pledge to build 11,000 new council homes and how it is still knocking down and selling off council homes faster than it is building new ones.

##Conclusion
Politics trumps common sense decision making yet again. Decisions based on rescuing aylesbury regeneration and Council homes pledge not on value for money.

Simon Morrow FRICS - estimated that the estate could be refurbished for £40k per dwelling.
