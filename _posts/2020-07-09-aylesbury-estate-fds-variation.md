## Southwark bails out Notting Hill Genesis

Southwark Council has announced that the First Development Site (FDS) of the Aylesbury estate regeneration will now deliver 520 council homes, increasing the number of social rented homes on the site by 280 units. The figures come from [a Cabinet report](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s89813/Report%20Aylesbury%20Regeneration%20programme%20-%20Delivery%20of%20New%20Council%20Homes.pdf) to be considered on Tuesday 14 June.  These will be the first new council homes on the regeneration.

Southwark will be paying for the new council homes, as well as 57 flexi-care and 7 specialist learning homes, while Notting Hill Genesis will build them.  This is a new _'arrangement'_ ; previously the homes were to have been built and paid for by Notting Hill Genesis, under the terms of [a planning permisssion](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s53361/Report.pdf) granted to Notting Hill Housing Trust, as it then was, in 2015. Southwark will pay £193m in development cost; it will also forego a further £17.8m in lost receipts from NHG, giving a total cost of £210.8m. Two GLA grants, totalling £54.5m, would bring the cost down to £156.3m [^1].

## The good news

Understandably, Southwark councillors are making the most of the gain in council housing, which is undeniably good news.  Local housing campaigners, both on and off the estate can also take credit - [reducing the loss of social housing](http://35percent.org/aylesbury-estate/) has been a consistent aim and at the centre of [many hard-fought battles](http://35percent.org/2017-05-08-aylesbury-cpo-what-has-really-happened/).

![](/img/kierontweet.png)

There are a couple of wrinkles though - a proportion of these social rented units will be needed to [rehouse leaseholders](http://www.aylesburynow.london/web/uploads/files/New_Homes/Information-for-Aylesbury-Leaseholders.pdf) decanted from later phases. How many remains to be seen - Phase 2 and 3 has 62 leaseholders yet to be bought out and their options include the [new shared equity scheme](http://moderngov.southwarksites.com/documents/s74901/Report%20Amending%20the%20shared%20equity%20rehousing%20policy%20for%20qualifying%20homeowners%20affected%20by%20regenerati.pdf) introduced in response to the Secretary of State's CPO [ruling](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/16/government-blocks-controversial-plan-to-force-out-housing-estate-residents) that BAME leaseholders were being wrongly displaced from their communities.

Also, the report is silent on whether the new council housing means that there will be a reduction in the net loss of social rented housing in the overall regeneration, or whether it is simply social housing being brought forward from later phases in the regeneration. The outline planning permission granted to NHG, who remain responsible for delivering the rest of the regeneration's 2,745 units, still allows for a net loss of between 778 and 1,166 social rented units [^2]:.

## The not-so-good news

Southwark Council presents the cost of building the new council and other FDS homes as being a reasonable £238.4k per unit. Southwark arrives at this figure by assuming receipt of two GLA grants, reducing development costs from £193m to £138.5m .

But only one GLA grant has been secured and leaving this out of the equation and including the loss of £17.8m from NHG (for the land, and contributions to infrastructure costs) gives a total cost to Southwark of £182m and a less flattering cost per unit of £313k.

Neither of the above calculations, though, take into account the major fact that under the existing deal with NHG, Southwark was to pay nothing - all the costs, for all the FDS housing, including 240 social rented units, were to be have been met by NHG.

So, while Southwark is now to get 560 council homes, instead of 240 social rented homes, this net gain requires an outlay of £193m gross - equivalent to £690k for each of the extra 260 units [^3]:.

## NHG takes all the private housing

NHG also get to keep part of the FDS land, so-called Package C, on which to build 261 homes for themselves, most of which, 191 units, will be private homes for sale.  These units comprise all the private housing on the FDS. There will also be 57 shared ownership, and 13 social rent (ref).

NHG will also continue to build the homes on Plot 18, most of which are again private -  99 private homes,   6 shared ownership and 17 social rent. (This is despite the fact that it is no longer paying £6m towards Plot 18's community infrastructure). Footnote para 54

This is all in stark contrast to the what NHG was supposed to deliver across the whole FDS under the [Development Partnership Agreement (DPA)](/img/aylesburyDPA.pdf) between Southwark and NHG, signed in 2014.  NHG was to build 365 social rented units, 217 shared ownership homes and 382 private homes, the idea being that revenus from the private homes would subsidise the cost of the affordable housing.  This model now appears to hae been abandoned. (Footnote OR 25, 52)

## An explanation?

NHG therefore appear to be walking away unscathed from their FDS obligations and while Southwark are getting many welcome council homes, they are having to dig deep financially to pay for them.  The Cabinet report notes a knock-on effect for future housing investment. (Footnote: OR 64)

An explanation for all this lies with the Development Partnership Agreement, which gives NHG an effective 'viability veto' on the progress of the regeneration. A DPA clause allows NHG to decide whether or not a particular plot or phase can proceed, depending on its viability.  This viability test includes a 21% 'priority return' of revenue to NHG and is determined by their own assessment.

NHG's circumstances have also changed for the worse since it signed the DPA in 2014.  It has been forced to  _'significantly scale back'_ its development pipeline, after a [Regulator of Social Housing report](https://www.insidehousing.co.uk/news/news/notting-hill-genesis-scales-back-development-plans-amid-changing-market-conditions-62506) last August concluded NHG _“faces a range of risks and exposure to sales”_, with more than 400 unsold private market homes sitting on its books.

Southwark, on the other hand, has invested heavily, both financially and politically, in delivering the Aylesbury regeneration. It has been decanting homes for nearly 10 years and now 500 or so stand empty, or are bing used for temporary accommodation. The  first FDS homes were supposed to have been completed this summer (a two year delay on the original timetable), but much of the site is still rubble.  Phase 2 is still not fully empty and no planning application has been submitted.  Furhter delays can be expected for any compulsory purchase order and a demolition notice.

![](/img/phasingaylesburynow.png)

It is therefore not difficult to see why Southwark might have felt compelled to make concessions to NHG, by taking over the delivery and meeting the cost of nearly all the affordable housing, while leaving all the revenue-generating free-market homes to NHG.

## NHG holds Southwark over a barrel - again

Southwark has been forced to make such concessions twice before. In September 2016, Southwark agreed to [underwrite or advance £22.1 million](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s63817/Report.Aylesbury%20Regeneration%20Delivery.pdf) to NHG, for the FDS demolition and design costs, including a payment of £16.8m for demolition, that was to have been paid by NHG.  This advance funding was to be recouped by the FDS land receipt, which will now not be paid. The [report agreeing](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s63817/Report.Aylesbury%20Regeneration%20Delivery.pdf) this also noted that Southwark was due to spend £52.5m on the Aylesbury regeneration by 2018/19. 

![](/img/nhttproceed.png)

In 2018, NHG was awarded £30m of GLA grant funding for the first phase of the scheme. The [Development Partnership Agreement](/img/aylesburyDPA.pdf) set out that any grant funding awarded to the scheme should go to Southwark, such that it receives some kind of remuneration for the sale of its land (see para 4.1, page 111). But NHG forced Southwark to agree to a variation allowing it to pocket the entire £30m.

## What next?

Gaining 540 council homes is a boon for everyone on Southwark who depends upon social housing.  Delivering these in the FDS phase also has the advantage that existing residents from later phases have a better chance of remaining on the Aylesbury.

But rescuing the Aylesbury regeneration is costing Southwark dearly.  Southwark is plugging holes left by NHG's failure to deliver.  Southwark is paying not just for council housing on its own account, but for the social rented homes that NHG should have paid for, with money that could be spent building council houses elsewhere.  Meantime NHG retains a choice piece of land, in the middle of the Aylesbury, to build nearly 200 private homes.  No figures are given in Tuesday's cabinet report of how much NHG stand to make from this.

This is also not the first time Southwark have come to NHG's rescue.  Southwark has also [spent £101m keeping the estate habitable](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s89813/Report%20Aylesbury%20Regeneration%20programme%20-%20Delivery%20of%20New%20Council%20Homes.pdf), while the regeneration stalls under NHG's stewardship.

At least four of the DPA milestones haven't been met:

![](/img/aylesburymilestones.png)

....and Southwark has the right to terminate the DPA if Notting Hill doesn't meet milestones:

![](/img/termination1.png)

There is also a clause that allows the Council to terminate 3 years after it was first found that a plot wasn't viable:

![](/img/termination2.png)

It would be a serious matter for Southwark to consider such a step, but past performance and its present situation indicates NHG may very well come back again for more concessions, requiring Southwark to spend money that might be otherwise used to build council houses elsewhere.

What the tweets didn't say is that providing these 219 extra social rented homes [will cost](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s89813/Report%20Aylesbury%20Regeneration%20programme%20-%20Delivery%20of%20New%20Council%20Homes.pdf) the Council an estimated £211 million pounds - that's a staggering £964k each home!

Neither did they explain that Southwark has also agreed to let its development partner Notting Hill Genesis continue to deliver the mainly private homes (290 private, 63 shared ownership and 64 social rent[^2]) that were supposed to cross-subsidise these social units without any contribution from NHG. Or that Southwark has also agreed to forgo the £6m that NHG was going to pay towards the £35m cost of building the new library and health centre.
