Yesterday, Southwark Councillors took to twitter to announce an increase in the number of social rented homes (219) to be provided on the first phase of the Aylesbury estate regeneration bringing the total to 614, to replace the 566 homes that have been demolished[^1].

What the tweets didn't say is these 219 extra social rented homes will cost the Council an estimated £211 million pounds - that's £964k each.

Neither did they explain that Southwark has also agreed to let NHG continue to deliver the xxx private homes (FDS and Plot 18 total) that were supposed to cross-subsidise these social units.   

Neither did they explain that a proportion of these social rented units won't be social rented at all, because they will be used to rehouse leaseholders being decanted from later phases under the Council's [new shared equity scheme.](http://moderngov.southwarksites.com/documents/s74901/Report%20Amending%20the%20shared%20equity%20rehousing%20policy%20for%20qualifying%20homeowners%20affected%20by%20regenerati.pdf) This was introduced in response to the Secretary of State's [ruling](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/16/government-blocks-controversial-plan-to-force-out-housing-estate-residents) that BAME leaseholders were being displaced from their communities.

##Background
Under the Development Partnership Agreement signed in 2014, NHG was supposed to deliver xxx social rented units, subisidised by xxx private units in this first phase of development.

But NHG negotiated a clause into the [Development Partnership Agreement]() which required the phases to be subdivided into plots and which enabled NHG to sit to not proceed with each given plot until it became financially viable.

This has led to numerable delays in the scheme. The Council started decanting the first development site in 2011 - now nearly ten years on it looks like this:

## History repeats
Southwark has alread rolled over once already to NHG as it has used its plot viability clause negotiated in the DPA as leverage to force concessions out of the Council, which is heavily invested politically in the scheme.

In September 2016, Southwark [forked out £21 million](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s63817/Report.Aylesbury%20Regeneration%20Delivery.pdf) in demolition and planning costs.

## The FDS 
In August last year, NHG was [forced](https://www.insidehousing.co.uk/news/news/notting-hill-genesis-scales-back-development-plans-amid-changing-market-conditions-62506) to 'significantly scale back' its development pipeline as it emerged that there were more than 400 unsold private market homes sitting on its books.

## 11,000 new Council homes
We blogged previously about Southwark's flagging pledge to build 11,000 new council homes and how it is still knocking down and selling off council homes faster than it is building new ones.

##Conclusion
Politics trumps common sense decision making yet again. Decisions based on rescuing aylesbury regeneration and Council homes pledge not on value for money.

[Evidence](http://35percent.org/ouraylesbury/cpo/#simon-morrow-sm) submitted to the 2018 CPO Public Inquiry by RICS qualified quantity surveyor Simon Morrow shows that the estate could be refurbished for just £45k - £65k per dwelling.
