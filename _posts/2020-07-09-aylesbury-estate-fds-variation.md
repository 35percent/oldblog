## Southwark bails out Notting Hill Genesis

Southwark Council has announced that the First Development Site (FDS) of the Aylesbury estate regeneration will now deliver 520 council homes, increasing the number of social rented homes on the site by 280 units. The figures come from [a Cabinet report](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s89813/Report%20Aylesbury%20Regeneration%20programme%20-%20Delivery%20of%20New%20Council%20Homes.pdf) to be considered on Tuesday 14 June.  These will be the first new council homes on the regeneration.

Southwark will be paying for the new council homes, as well as 57 flexi-care and 7 specialist learning homes, while Notting Hill Genesis will build them.  This is a new _'arrangement'_ ; the homes were to have been built and paid for by Notting Hill Genesis, under the terms of [a planning permisssion](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s53361/Report.pdf) granted to Notting Hill Housing Trust, as it then was, in 2015. Southwark will pay £193m in development cost; it will also forego a further £17.8m in lost receipts from NHG, giving a total cost of £210.8m. Two GLA grants, totalling £54.5m, would bring the cost down to £156.3m (Footnote OR 52, 54).

## The good news

Understandably, Southwark councillors are making the most of the gain in council housing, which is undeniably good news.  Local housing campaigners, both on and off the estate can also take credit - reducing the loss of social housing and getting council housing has been their consistent aim and at the centre of many hard-fought battles (link).

There are a couple of wrinkles though - a proportion of these social rented units will be needed to [rehouse leaseholders](http://www.aylesburynow.london/web/uploads/files/New_Homes/Information-for-Aylesbury-Leaseholders.pdf) decanted from later phases. How many remains to be seen - Phase 2 and 3 has 62 leaseholders yet to be bought out and their options include the [new shared equity scheme](http://moderngov.southwarksites.com/documents/s74901/Report%20Amending%20the%20shared%20equity%20rehousing%20policy%20for%20qualifying%20homeowners%20affected%20by%20regenerati.pdf) introduced in response to the Secretary of State's CPO [ruling](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/16/government-blocks-controversial-plan-to-force-out-housing-estate-residents) that BAME leaseholders were being wrongly displaced from their communities.

Also, the report is silent on whether the council housing means that there will be a reduction in the net loss of social rented housing in the overall regeneration or whether it is simply social housing being brought forward from later phases in the regeneration. The outline planning permission granted to NHG, who remain responsible for delivering the rest of the regeneration's 2,745 units, still allows for a net loss of between 778 and 1,166 social rented units.

## The not-so-good news

Southwark Council presents the cost of building the new council and other FDS homes as being a reasonable £238.4k per unit. Southwark arrives at this figure by assuming receipt of two GLA grants, reducing development costs from £193m to £138.5m.

But only one GLA grant has been secured and leaving this out of the equation and including the loss of £17.8m from NHG (for the land, and contributions to infrastructure costs) gives a total cost to Southwark of £182m and a less flattering cost per unit of £313k.

Neither of the above calculations, though, take into account the major fact that under the existing deal with NHG, Southwark was to pay nothing - all the costs, for all the FDS housing, including 240 social rented units, were to be have been met by NHG.

So, while Southwark is now to get 560 council homes, instead of 240 social rented homes, this net gain requires an outlay of £193m gross - equivalent to £690k for each of the extra 260 units.

## NHG takes all the private housing

NHG also get to keep part of the FDS land, so-called Package C, on which to build 261 homes for themselves, most of which, 191 units, will be private homes for sale.  These units comprise all the private housing on the FDS. (ref0

NHG wiil also build  57 shared ownership, and 13 social rent, but this is still in stark contrast to the what NHG was supposed to deliver across the whole FDS under the [Development Partnership Agreement (DPA)](/img/aylesburyDPA.pdf) between Southwark and NHG, signed in 2014.  NHG was to build 365 social rented units, 217 shared ownership homes and 382 private homes, the idea being that revenus from the private homes would subsidise the cost of the affordable housing.  This model now appears to hae been abandoned. (Footnote OR 25, 52) 


## An explanation?

NHG therefore appear to be walking away unscathed from their FDS obligations and while Southwark are getting many welcome council homes, they are having to dig deep financially to pay for them.  The Cabinet report notes a knock-on effect for future housing investment. (Footnote: OR 64)

An explanation for all this lies with the Development Partnership Agreement, which gives NHG an effective 'viability veto' on the progress of the regeneration. A DPA clause allows NHG to decide whether or not a particular plot or phase can proceed, depending on its viability.  This viability test includes a 21% 'priority return' of revenue to NHG and is determined by their own assessment.

NHG's circumstances have also changed for the worse since it signed the DPA in 2014.  It has been forced to  _'significantly scale back'_ its development pipeline, after a [Regulator of Social Housing report](https://www.insidehousing.co.uk/news/news/notting-hill-genesis-scales-back-development-plans-amid-changing-market-conditions-62506) last August concluded NHG _“faces a range of risks and exposure to sales”_, with more than 400 unsold private market homes sitting on its books.

Southwark, on the other hand, has invested heavily, both financially and politically, in delivering the Aylesbury regeneration. It has been decanting homes for nearly 10 years and now 500 or so stand empty, or are bing used for temporary accommodation. The  first FDS homes were supposed to have been completed this summer (a two year delay on the original timetable), but much of the site is still rubble.  Phase 2 is still not fully empty and no planning application has been submitted.  Furhter delays can be expected for any compulsory purchase order and a demolition notice.

It is therefore not difficult to see why Southwark might have felt compelled to make concessions to NHG, by taking over the delivery and meeting the cost of nearly all the affordable housing, while leaving all the revenue-generating free-market homes to NHG.


## NHG holds Southwark over a barrel

These new arrangements are themselves changes to  arrangments previously changed in NHG's favour back in 2016.

Southwark has been forced to make such concessions twice before. In September 2016, Southwark agreed to [pay out £21 million](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s63817/Report.Aylesbury%20Regeneration%20Delivery.pdf) in demolition and planning costs, that were originally to be met by NHG (explain).  This advance funding was to be recouped by the FDS land receipt; the fact that the land receipt figure of £17.8m now falls short of the £21m advanced by Southwark is now of course irrelevant, given that Southwark is to receive nothing at all.

![](/img/nhttproceed.png)

In 2018, NHG was awarded £30m of GLA grant funding for the first phase of the scheme. The [Development Partnership Agreement](/img/aylesburyDPA.pdf) set out that any grant funding awarded to the scheme should go to Southwark, such that it receives some kind of remuneration for the sale of its land (see para 4.1, page 111). But NHG forced Southwark to agree to a variation allowing it to pocket the entire £30m.

## What next?

There is also a big question now to be asked about what role Notting Hill Genensis will play in the remainder of the regeneration, which is only half complete (no of homes to be built?) and years behaind schedule.  NHG still has the planning permission for this and a development partnership agreement Southwark Councils to deliver it. 

## Conclusion

Gaining 540 council homes is a boon for everyone on Southwark who depends upon social housing.  Delivering thses in the FDS phase also has the advantage that existing residents from later phases have a better chance of remaining on the Aylesbury.

But rescuing the Aylesbury regeneration is costing Southwark dearly.  Southwark is plugging a hole left by NHG's failure to deliver.  Southwark is paying not just for council housing on its own account, but for the social rented homes that NHG should have paid for, with money that could be spent building council houses elsewhere.  Meantime NHG retains a choice piece of land, in the middle of the Aylesbury, to build nearly 200 private homes.  No figures are given in Tuesday's cabinet report of how much NHG stand to make from this.

This is also not the first time Southwark have come to NHG's rescue, as witnessed by the transfer of FDS demolition costs.  Southwark is also spending significant amounts (link) keeping the estate habitable while the regeneration stalls, under NHG's stewardship.  According to the original Aylesbury Area Action Plan timetable Phase 1 should have been completed by 2016, Phase 2 by 2018, Phase 3 by 2020; Phase 4 should be underway - yet we are still stuck on Phase 1 (Footnote Aylesbury Area Action Plan Table A5.1: Schedule of proposals sites).

Tuesday's cabinet report acknowledges that the cross-subsidy model, where the proceeds of private house sales subsidise the deleivery of affordable housing is dead, at least on he FDS.  If this is to be the case for the remainder of the regeneration, then there is really no need for NHG.  Southwark should at least make it clear that there will be no more bail-outs; better still it should start negotiating an amicable divorce.

This week, Southwark Councillors took to twitter to announce an increase in the number of social rented homes by 219 to be provided on the first phase of the Aylesbury estate regeneration bringing the total to 614, to replace the 566 homes that have been demolished[^1]. 

![](/img/kierontweet.png)

What the tweets didn't say is that providing these 219 extra social rented homes [will cost](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s89813/Report%20Aylesbury%20Regeneration%20programme%20-%20Delivery%20of%20New%20Council%20Homes.pdf) the Council an estimated £211 million pounds - that's a staggering £964k each home!

Neither did they explain that Southwark has also agreed to let its development partner Notting Hill Genesis continue to deliver the mainly private homes (290 private, 63 shared ownership and 64 social rent[^2]) that were supposed to cross-subsidise these social units without any contribution from NHG. Or that Southwark has also agreed to forgo the £6m that NHG was going to pay towards the £35m cost of building the new library and health centre.

## Background - viability clause and delays
Under the Development Partnership Agreement signed in 2014, NHG was supposed to deliver 365 social rented units, subisidised by 382 private homes and 217 shared ownership homes this first phase of development.

But NHG negotiated a clause into the [Development Partnership Agreement (DPA)](/img/aylesburyDPA.pdf) which gave it the option not to proceed with each given plot of each phase until it becomes financially viable.  

![](/img/pvc.png)

This sounds like a sensible clause at first glance, except for the fact that in calculating viability a plot is only deemed viable if it provides NHG with a minimum profit of 21%:

![](/img/nhtprofit.png)

This has led to inumerable delays in the scheme. The Council started decanting tenants from the first two phases nearly ten years ago and the first new homes were supposed to be completed this summer, but the first development site is still largely a pile of rubble and phase 2 hasn't even been fully decanted yet.

![](/img/phasingaylesburynow.png)

In fact, there isn't even a planning application submitted for phase 2 yet, let alone compulsory purchase order and demolition notice issued. Meanwhile circa 500 homes stand empty in the middle of a housing crisis and global pandemic. 

![](/img/phase2empties.png)

The delays and years of council homes standing empty or plots standing empty after they have been demolished is not a good look for the Council and it has come under political pressure as a result. NHG has used this as leverage to hold the Council over a barrel and force concessions, just as Lendlease did with the Council at the neighbouring Heygate estate regeneration.

## NHG holds Southwark over a barrel (yet again)
Southwark has alread rolled over twice already to NHG as it has used its plot viability clause negotiated in the DPA as leverage to force concessions out of the Council, which is heavily invested politically in the scheme.

In September 2016, Southwark [forked out £21 million](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s63817/Report.Aylesbury%20Regeneration%20Delivery.pdf) in demolition and planning costs.

![](/img/nhttproceed.png)

In 2018, NHG was awarded £30m of GLA grant funding for the first phase of the scheme. The [Development Partnership Agreement](/img/aylesburyDPA.pdf) set out that any grant funding awarded to the scheme should go to Southwark, such that it receives some kind of remuneration for the sale of its land (see para 4.1, page 111). But NHG forced Southwark to agree to a variation allowing it to pocket the entire £30m.

## The FDS 
In August last year, NHG was [forced](https://www.insidehousing.co.uk/news/news/notting-hill-genesis-scales-back-development-plans-amid-changing-market-conditions-62506) to 'significantly scale back' its development pipeline as it emerged that there were more than 400 unsold private market homes sitting on its books.

## 11,000 new Council homes
We blogged previously about Southwark's flagging pledge to build 11,000 new council homes and how it is still knocking down and selling off council homes faster than it is building new ones.

## Parked termination clauses
The Council does indeed have the right to terminate the DPA if Notting Hill doesn't meet the milestones set out in the DPA:

![](/img/termination1.png)

At least four of these milestones clearly haven't been met:

The Council also has a clause allowing it to terminate 3 years after it was first found that a plot wasn't viable:
