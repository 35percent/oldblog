## Southwark bail out Notting Housing Genesis

Southwark Council has announced that the First Development Site (FDS) phase of the Aylesbury state regeneration will now deliver 520 council homes, increasing the number of social rented homes on the phase by 280 units. The figures come from [a Cabinet report](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s89813/Report%20Aylesbury%20Regeneration%20programme%20-%20Delivery%20of%20New%20Council%20Homes.pdf) to be considered on Tuesday 14 June.  These will be the first new council homes on the regeneration; xxxx social rented homes, managed by L&Q, out of a total yyy new homes have already been built.  The whole regeneration should deliver a total of over 4,000 new homes, 70% of which will be affordable, half of which will be social rented.

The new FDS homes were to be built and paid for by Notting Hill Genesis,under the terms of [a planning permisssion](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s53361/Report.pdf) granted to Notting Hill Housing Trust, as it then was, in 2015.  NHG will still build the homes (plus 61 more), but now Southwark will pay for them - £193m in development cost, to which must be added a further £17.8m in lost reciepts from NHG, giving a grand total of £210.8m (Footnote OR 52).

## The good news

Understandably, Southwark councillors are making the most of the gain in council housing, which is undeniably good news.  Local housing campaigners, both on and off the estate can also take credit - reducing the loss of social housing and getting council housing has been their consistent aim and at the centre of hard-fought campaigns (link).

There are couple of wrinkles though - a proportion of these social rented units will be needed to [rehouse leaseholders](http://www.aylesburynow.london/web/uploads/files/New_Homes/Information-for-Aylesbury-Leaseholders.pdf) decanted from later phases. How many remains to be seen - Phase 2 and 3 has 62 leaseholders yet to be bought out and their options include the[new shared equity scheme.](http://moderngov.southwarksites.com/documents/s74901/Report%20Amending%20the%20shared%20equity%20rehousing%20policy%20for%20qualifying%20homeowners%20affected%20by%20regenerati.pdf) introduced in response to the Secretary of State's CPO [ruling](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/16/government-blocks-controversial-plan-to-force-out-housing-estate-residents) that BAME leaseholders were being wrongly displaced from their communities.

NHG are also hanging on to some of the FDS, so-called Package C, to build 261 homes for themselves, 191 of which will be private (ref).

Also the report is silent on whether the council housing means that there will be a reduction in the net loss of social rented housing in the overall regeneration or whether it is simply social housing being brought forward from later phases in the regeneration. The outline planning permission granted to NHG, who remain responsible for delivering the rest of the regeneration's 2,745 units, still allows for a net loss of between 778 and 1,166 social rented units.



## The not-so-good news



leaseholders, Package C, decrease in projected social housing loss  - but the biggest downside is the cost.

Southwark present this as £xxxxx, but another more ??? wayof looking at it ist that Southwark is paying £yyyyy for an extra xxxxx social rented units, meaning a eyewatering cost of £964k (?) for each home.  Death of cross ubsidy model.

There is also a big question to be asked about what role Notting Hill Genensis will play in the remainder of the regeneration, which is only half complete (no of homes to be built?) and years behaind schedule.  NHG still has the planning permission for this and a development partnership agreement Southwark Councils to deliver it.  

The proposed revised delivery arrangements would allow 581 new homes to be delivered under Package A & B as council homes at social rents, representing an additional 280 social rent homes



This week, Southwark Councillors took to twitter to announce an increase in the number of social rented homes by 219 to be provided on the first phase of the Aylesbury estate regeneration bringing the total to 614, to replace the 566 homes that have been demolished[^1]. 

![](/img/kierontweet.png)

What the tweets didn't say is that providing these 219 extra social rented homes [will cost](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s89813/Report%20Aylesbury%20Regeneration%20programme%20-%20Delivery%20of%20New%20Council%20Homes.pdf) the Council an estimated £211 million pounds - that's a staggering £964k each home!

Neither did they explain that Southwark has also agreed to let its development partner Notting Hill Genesis continue to deliver the mainly private homes (290 private, 63 shared ownership and 64 social rent[^2]) that were supposed to cross-subsidise these social units without any contribution from NHG. Or that Southwark has also agreed to forgo the £6m that NHG was going to pay towards the £35m cost of building the new library and health centre.

## Background - viability clause and delays
Under the Development Partnership Agreement signed in 2014, NHG was supposed to deliver 365 social rented units, subisidised by 382 private homes and 217 shared ownership homes this first phase of development.

But NHG negotiated a clause into the [Development Partnership Agreement (DPA)](/img/aylesburyDPA.pdf) which gave it the option not to proceed with each given plot of each phase until it becomes financially viable.  

![](/img/pvc.png)

This sounds like a sensible clause at first glance, except for the fact that in calculating viability a plot is only deemed viable if it provides NHG with a minimum profit of 21%:

![](/img/nhtprofit.png)

This has led to inumerable delays in the scheme. The Council started decanting tenants from the first two phases nearly ten years ago and the first new homes were supposed to be completed this summer, but the first development site is still largely a pile of rubble and phase 2 hasn't even been fully decanted yet.

![](/img/phasingaylesburynow.png)

In fact, there isn't even a planning application submitted for phase 2 yet, let alone compulsory purchase order and demolition notice issued. Meanwhile circa 500 homes stand empty in the middle of a housing crisis and global pandemic.

The delays and years of council homes standing empty or plots standing empty after they have been demolished is not a good look for the Council and it has come under political pressure as a result. NHG has used this as leverage to hold the Council over a barrel and force concessions, just as Lendlease did with the Council at the neighbouring Heygate estate regeneration.

## NHG holds Southwark over a barrel (yet again)
Southwark has alread rolled over twice already to NHG as it has used its plot viability clause negotiated in the DPA as leverage to force concessions out of the Council, which is heavily invested politically in the scheme.

In September 2016, Southwark [forked out £21 million](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s63817/Report.Aylesbury%20Regeneration%20Delivery.pdf) in demolition and planning costs.

![](/img/nhttproceed.png)

In 2018, NHG was awarded £30m of GLA grant funding for the first phase of the scheme. The [Development Partnership Agreement](/img/aylesburyDPA.pdf) set out that any grant funding awarded to the scheme should go to Southwark, such that it receives some kind of remuneration for the sale of its land (see para 4.1, page 111). But NHG forced Southwark to agree to a variation allowing it to pocket the entire £30m.

## The FDS 
In August last year, NHG was [forced](https://www.insidehousing.co.uk/news/news/notting-hill-genesis-scales-back-development-plans-amid-changing-market-conditions-62506) to 'significantly scale back' its development pipeline as it emerged that there were more than 400 unsold private market homes sitting on its books.

## 11,000 new Council homes
We blogged previously about Southwark's flagging pledge to build 11,000 new council homes and how it is still knocking down and selling off council homes faster than it is building new ones.

## Conclusion
Politics trumps common sense decision making yet again. Decisions based on rescuing aylesbury regeneration and Council homes manifesto pledges not on providng best value for money in terms of Council spending.

[Evidence](http://35percent.org/ouraylesbury/cpo/#simon-morrow-sm) submitted to the 2018 CPO Public Inquiry by RICS qualified quantity surveyor Simon Morrow shows that the estate could be refurbished for just £45k per home for a 1-bed and £65k for a 4-bed. £69M housing scrutiny committee heating. Annual revenue.  Value for money no - political considerations decided

## Parked termination clauses
The Council does indeed have the right to terminate the DPA if Notting Hill doesn't meet the milestones set out in the DPA:

![](/img/termination1.png)

At least four of these milestones clearly haven't been met:

![](/img/aylesburymilestones.png)

The Council also has a clause allowing it to terminate 3 years after it was first found that a plot wasn't viable:

How could it be better spent?  £101m on heating; Overview and scrutiny committee

the giant housing association that was granted [planning permissions in 2015](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=119&MId=4808&Ver=4), as Notting Hill Housing Trust, to build over 3,500 homes to complete the regeneration.  Southwark is taking over most of the FDS, and relieving Notting Hill Genesis of the obligation it has
