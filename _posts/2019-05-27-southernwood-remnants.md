Former deputy Council leader turned development consultant has assisted by ['providing public affairs and stakeholder engagement services and arranging meetings with key stakeholders'](http://carvil-ventures.co.uk/southernwood-retail-park-old-kent-road). 

[Objections](https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/historic-england-raises-concern-over-pilbrow-and-partners-southwark-tower/10038794.article) have been made by Historic England.

Despite both Southwark and Glasgow City Council being signed up to and active members of the Living Wage Campaign, neither have decided to use their respective influence to ensure that any employees associated with the construction of this scheme or the ongoing running of the cinema are paid the London Living Wage.

*Paragraph 141 of the [planning committee report](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s82616/Report%20Southernwood%20Retail%20Park%202%20Humphrey%20Street%20London%20SE1%205JJ.pdf)*

Southwark's [independent review](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!wHlqJHGSqYenUM8dzFIwTw%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) of the applicant's viability assessment raises the issue of a £4.7m unitemised cost - unexplained because of 'commercial confidentiality'.

There's little point in forcing developers to disclose viability assessments if major components of these can't be interrogated because of 'commercial confidentiality'.

Glasgow's pension fund's [viability assessment](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!usFYGB9yhRh95Q0p6tmP8g%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) also claims that it will incur a £44m financing cost, representing 7% interest on loans that it will have to take out to fund the scheme. This is not supported by any evidence - there is no explanation why a pension fund with over £20 billion in funds would need to borrow money. 


It joins Ruby Triangle, Cantium Retail Park and Malt St as [one of four major developments](https://www.homesandproperty.co.uk/property-news/old-kent-road-set-for-major-highrise-transformation-with-20000-new-homes-if-bakerloo-line-extension-a125611.html),delivering xxxx homes in total, that have or will be determined in advance of the adoption of the [Old Kent Rd Area Action Plan]  (https://www.southwark.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning-policy-and-transport-policy/development-plan/area-action-plans?chapter=2). Numerous smaller developments are also [in the pipeline](link).

The [Mayor's policy](https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/planning/london-plan/new-london-plan/draft-new-london-plan/chapter-4-housing/policy-h6-threshold-approach-applications) has two exceptions where in the case of public land or sites in Strategic Industrial Locations the threshold is increased to 50%.
