title: "Castle Square - Delancey responds"
subtitle: "Small progress but still not enough on traders' temporary premises"

Since our [last blog](http://35percent.org/2018-10-30-shopping-centre-legal-challenge/) on 30th October on the Elephant & Castle shopping centre, over 100 objections have been made to the proposals for a temporary facility for traders on Castle Square.

In response, Delancey have submitted a two-page document covering rent levels, tenancy agreements, service charges, selection criteria, hours of operation, access and the relocation fund. There is now a reconsultation on Delancey's planning application.

There has been one clear gain - the facility will now have lift access, but otherwise Delancey does little more than restate its previous position.

Delancey claims that while there will be no affordable retail, the proposed rents are _"discounted in excess of the requirements of the Elephant & Castle SPD"_. This is the policy that sets affordable retail rents. 

Delancey also states that traders will be given first right of refusal to the temporary units at Castle Square and units will not be let to others until Delancey have this in writing. 

However, the size of the facility is still less than 500m2 and there is no increase to the relocation fund of Â£634k.

There is also still no agreement with the traders on any of these and the other issues such as the trading hours and service charges.

Moreover, the Traders Panel has only just got off the ground with no traders yet appointed to the Panel. 

Until this happens none of these issues can be said to be settled and the "robust allocation strategy" that Mayor Sadiq Khan is asking for will not be achieved. 

Many of our readers have previously submitted objections. We have drafted a revised objection in light of the minor revisions submitted by Delancey.

We must ensure that the traders get the best possible deal, whatever happens; they need the temporary facility, but it must be better; if you would like to help achieve this, please submit an objection using [online objection form](http://35percent.org/boxpark#object.
