Since our [last blog](http://35percent.org/2018-10-30-shopping-centre-legal-challenge/) on the Elephant & Castle shopping centre saga, over 100 objections have been made to the temporary boxpark proposals for traders on Castle Square.

In response, Delancey has submitted a two-page document covering rent levels, tenancy agreements, service charges, selection criteria, hours of operation, access and the relocation fund. There is now a reconsultation on the planning application proposals.

One clear improvement has been made - the facility will now have lift access -  but otherwise Delancey does little more than restate its previous position.

There will still be no affordable retail units, but Delancey [claims](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!chJya7aQe7u2p4T5F1pEDA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) that the proposed rents are _"discounted in excess of the requirements of the Elephant & Castle SPD"_. 

Delancey also states that traders will be given first right of refusal to the temporary units at Castle Square and units will not be let to others until Delancey receive refusals in writing. 

However, the size of the facility is still only 492 square metres and there is no increase to the relocation fund of Â£634k.

There is also still no agreement with the traders on any of these and the other issues such as the trading hours,service charges and selection criteria.

Moreover, the Traders Panel has only just got off the ground, with no traders yet appointed to the Panel. 

Until this happens none of these issues can be said to be settled and the _"robust relocation strategy"_ that Mayor [Sadiq Khan is asking for](https://www.change.org/p/sadiq-khan-sadiq-say-no-to-the-displacement-of-bame-communities-from-elephant-castle/responses/41627) will not be achieved. 

Many of our readers have previously submitted objections. We have drafted a revised objection in light of the minor revisions submitted by Delancey.

We must ensure that the traders get the best possible deal, whatever happens; they need the temporary facility, but it must be better; if you would like to help achieve this, please submit an objection using our [online objection form](http://35percent.org/boxpark#object).
