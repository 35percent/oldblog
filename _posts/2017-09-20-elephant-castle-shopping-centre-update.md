Latest update on the Elephant & Castle shopping centre redevelopment:

1. Still proposing half the amount of social rented housing required by policy.
2. Still proposing (?%) less than the required 10% affordable retail.
3. Still fails to make any re-provision for the bingo hall.

A viability assessment was submitted in December last year by Delancey, justifying its departures from policy requirements. Despite Southwark's new policy it hasn't been made public.

Bingo hall is effectively a community facility for 500 local pensioners every day.

Calls for the bingo hall to be re-provided in the new development have been rejected by Delancey. Southwark claims it is powerless to force Delancey to re-provide a new bingo hall but Delancey is completely reliant on Southwark for this redevelopment to proceed. Without Southwark exercising its compulsory purchase powers to terminate the bingo hall's lease and several other of the shopping centre's long-term traders, Delancey cannot proceed with its scheme.

With its compulsory purchase powers, Southwark holds the key to Delancey's regeneration, it should take a firm stance with Delancey - either you comply with affordable housing and affordable retail policy requirements and re-provide a bingo hall or we won't exercise our compulsory purchase powers.

        <textarea name="message" id="message" cols="55" rows="10">Dear Southwark Planning,

I am writing to object to the revised planning application for the redevelopment of the shopping centre and LCC campus at the Elephant & Castle (ref:16/AP/4458).

Affordable Housing:
This application does not propose a policy compliant affordable housing mix. Southwark's policy for the Elephant & Castle requires a minimum of 35% affordable housing, of which 50% must be social rented. The applicant is proposing a different tenure of housing, only 9% of which will be at social rent levels.

Affordable retail & existing traders:
The Council's strategic planning framework requires a minimum 10% affordable retail for new developments. Paragraph 5.1.7 of the Council's local planning policy (E&C SPD), further requires a number of "affordable retail units which are made available to existing occupiers displaced by development", in order to "ensure that development opportunities provide opportunities for existing and future SME businesses". The applicant's proposals fail to meet the Council's minimum 10% affordable retail requirement.

Bingo Hall:
Delancey is failing to make re-provision for the existing bingo hall. This provides community facilities for 500 local pensioners every day. This important facility must be retained in any new development in order to ensure that community benefits are not lost without being replaced.

This application should not be considered by the Council until the above shortcomings have been addressed. 

Yours sincerely,
</textarea>
