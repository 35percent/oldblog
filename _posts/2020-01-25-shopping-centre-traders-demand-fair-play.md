## Elephant traders to send deputation to Southwark Council Assembly

A deputation of shopping centre traders are due to attend Southwark Concil's Assembley meeting this Tuesday (link), to demand fair treatment from developer Delancey and the Council.  This follows Delancey's announcement that it intends to close the centre on 31 July 2020 (link).  All the businesses in the centre, including the market traders, must move before then, but despite a relocation package (Southwark link), about 60 traders still have nowhere to go, according to research by local charity Latin Elephant (link).  Representatives from Latin Elpehant and Southwark Law Centre will be joining the traders on the deputation.

The traders deputation will present seven demands to the Assembly, which is a meeting of all Southwark's councillors.  These are;

1.	that Delancey increases the relocation fund.  This is currently Â£634,700, with traders having to demonstrate 'hardship' for Delancey to consider increasing the amount beyond this.

2.	that the the rent and service charge costs of the relocation options are brought into line with each other.  Of the four main relocation options the most expensive,Perronet House, is owned by Southwark Council.
The others are owned by either Delancey (Castle Square, Elephant One) or fellow developer Lendlease  (Elephant Park) and are cheaper.

3.	that the businesses in Arch 7 are fully included in the relocation strategy and can draw from the relocation fund.  Railway arches 6 and 7, beneath the shopping centre, are due to be kocked through, displacing the businesses there; they cannot apply for relocation money under the current rules for the fund.

4.	that the the market traders around the centre are equally and fairly treated and that all traders get a benefit of rent reductions, until the shopping centre closes.  Rent reductions made because of the disruption to trade have not been passed on to the market traders.

5.	that the independent business adviser, Tree Shepherd, applies the agreed criteria for the allocation of relocation spaces in a fair and transparent way.  Traders of longstanding have not been offered alternative premises or have been offered premises not suitable for their businesses.

6.	that the database of opportunities reflects what was agreed on the approval of planning permission. This database should give information about vacant premises within a mile of the centre and within Southwark, but has not proved helpful. 

7.	that the shopping centre is not closed until every independent traders is relocated or receives financial compensation.  The independent traders have been at the heart of the Elephant and Castle for decades.  The Elephant regeneration is trumpeted as a great benefit for the local community and local people; if this is to be true then all the independnat traders must be fairly treated, with either new premises or compensation.
