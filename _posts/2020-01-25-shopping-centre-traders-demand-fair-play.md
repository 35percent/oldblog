## Elephant traders to send deputation to Southwark Council Assembly

A deputation of shopping centre traders are due to attend Southwark Concil's Assembley meeting this Tuesday, to demand fair treatment from developer Delancey and the Council.  This follows Delancey's announcement that it intends to close the centre on 31 July 2020.  All the businesses in the centre, including the market traders, must move before then, but despite a relocation package (Southwark link), about 60 traders still have no where to go, according to research by local charity Latin Elephant (link).
