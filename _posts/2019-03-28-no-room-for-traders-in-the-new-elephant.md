## Shopping centre Traders left out in the cold

Just 36 independent traders from the Elephant  & Castle shopping centre have been allocated new space to trade, in the event of the centre's demolition and redevelopment.

The figures were given at a testy meeting of the Trader Panel on 19 March and leave at least [40 traders out in the cold](https://twitter.com/LatinElephant?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor), according to [Latin Elephant](https://latinelephant.org/), who champion the cause of all independant ethnic minirity traders.  It's been reported [28 applications for space were actually rejected](https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/nearly-30-elephant-and-castle-traders-rejected-for-delancey-relocation-units/).

The new spaces are a mixture of permanent affordable units, at the base of the Elephant One Tower and the 'Elephant Arcade', on the ground floor of Perronet House, and temporary affordable units in the planned retail facility at Castle Square.

## Eelphant Park gone missing

Noticably absent from the relocation sites are the affordable retail units on Elephant Park, formerly the Heygate estate.  At over 1300 sqm, this is by far the largest of the four sites [presented to Southwark's planning committee](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!HvOs1eG7BYgl0hYZ8SIm5w%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) as alternatives for displaced traders.  It was also specifically referred to as able to [supply 38 affordable units](https://twitter.com/elephant_petit/status/1081278395504197633) when the Castle Square facility was appoved back in January. 

This debacle was entirely predictable.

Wishful thinking - officer's report 
As Latin Elephant objected back in March 2018 the amount of affordable retail space available falls far short of the 4000 sqm  https://latinelephant.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2018-03-09-LE-Objection-Deferred-Appl.pdf
