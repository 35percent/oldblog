## Shopping centre Traders left out in the cold

Just 36 independent traders from the Elephant  & Castle shopping centre have been allocated new space to trade, in the event of the centre's demolition and redevelopment.

The figures were given at a testy meeting of the Trader Panel on 19 March and leave at least [40 traders out in the cold](https://twitter.com/LatinElephant?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor), according to [Latin Elephant](https://latinelephant.org/), who champion the cause of all independant ethnic minirity traders.  It's been reported [28 applications for space were actually rejected](https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/nearly-30-elephant-and-castle-traders-rejected-for-delancey-relocation-units/).

The new spaces are a mixture of permanent affordable units, at the base of the Elephant One Tower and the 'Elephant Arcade', on the ground floor of Perronet House, and temporary affordable units in the planned retail facility at Castle Square.

## The Elephant Effect

Noticably absent from the relocation sites are the affordable retail units on Elephant Park, formerly the Heygate estate.  At over 1300 sqm, with 800sqm available in 2019, this is by far the largest of the four sites [presented to Southwark's planning committee](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!HvOs1eG7BYgl0hYZ8SIm5w%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) as alternatives for displaced traders.  It was also specifically referred to as able to [supply 38 affordable units](https://twitter.com/elephant_petit/status/1081278395504197633) when the Castle Square facility was appoved back in January.

Unlike the other 3 sites, Elephant Park is under Lendlease control, not Delancey or Southwark, so the suspicion is that it has no desire to help its competitor, or Southwark, relocate traders, notwithstanding the [_'imagination, empathy and dedication'_](https://www.lendlease.com/uk/projects/elephant-park/?id=3c8e138c-140a-4268-8cba-199afaec168d) it claims to be bringing to the Elephant & Castle.

## So it cam to pass...

This was an entirely predictable debacle.  Objectors, pre-eminently Latin Elephant, have consistently pointed out that Delancey's evolving relocation strategy simply did not provide enough space to accommodate all the traders who wish to stay at the Elephant and this has remainded the case, even as the number of traders has inevitably changed over time.  

In the summer of 2017 Southwark estimated that there were about 130 independent businesses, occupying 4005sqm within the 'red-line' of the development (excluding the Hannibal House office space), as [cited by Latin Elephant](https://twitter.com/LatinElephant/status/1081169626590048258).  Latin Elephant calculated that all available space, including Elephant Park (and throwing in pitches in East St market, nearly a mile down the road), could accommodate 84 businesses on 2,263 sqm - not much more than half the floorspace required and leaving at least 38 eligible buinesses out in the cold.

In March 2018, Latin Elephant used its research as the basis of its objection that the amount of affordable retail space available [fell far short of the 4000 sqm needed](https://latinelephant.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2018-03-09-LE-Objection-Deferred-Appl.pdf).  Nonetheless, when Delancey's application was finally considered by the planning committeew, the [officer's report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!HvOs1eG7BYgl0hYZ8SIm5w%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d), (while legitimately ignoring the affordable retail in Perronet House and Castle Square on the grounds that they did not then have planning approval), lumped the affordable retail proposed for the new shopping centre (completion date 2029), in with the affordable retail in Elephant One and Elphant Park, to reach the comforting conclusion that this amounted to 3866sqm and was _'only marginally short...of the 4,005sqm of space currently occupied by independent retailers on the east site'_ (para 221).

By December 2018, Perronet House had been approved and Castle Square itself went to planning committee, so the officer's report for this wisely drops any reference to the shopping centre, to reach an affordable retail total of 2,859sqm.  The [report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!12dhIwvd2JFDUQgBXBnMXA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) acknowledges that _'whilst this would be less than the
4,005sqm currently understood to be occupied by independent businesses on the east site, some businesses may be able to operate from smaller premises_'(para 57).  Southwark now identifies 80 businesses in the redline and gives [verbal assurances](https://twitter.com/elephant_petit/status/1081278395504197633) that there _'should be sufficient'_ units to accommodate everyone.

Southwark and Delancey have responded by underestimating the number of traders and with wishful thinking.
