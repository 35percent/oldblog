## Shopping centre Traders left out in the cold

Just 36 independent traders from the Elephant  & Castle shopping centre have been allocated new space to trade, in the event of the centre's demolition and redevelopment.

The figures were given at a testy meeting of the Trader Panel on 19 March and leave at least [40 traders out in the cold](https://twitter.com/LatinElephant?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor), according to [Latin Elephant](https://latinelephant.org/), who champion the cause of all independant ethnic minirity traders.  It's been reported [28 applications for space were actually rejected](https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/nearly-30-elephant-and-castle-traders-rejected-for-delancey-relocation-units/).

The new spaces are a mixture of permanent affordable units, at the base of the Elephant One Tower and the 'Elephant Arcade', on the ground floor of Perronet House, and temporary affordable units in the planned retail facility at Castle Square.

## The Elephant Effect

Noticably absent from the relocation sites are the affordable retail units on Elephant Park, formerly the Heygate estate.  At over 1300 sqm, with 800sqm available in 2019, this is by far the largest of the four sites [presented to Southwark's planning committee](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!HvOs1eG7BYgl0hYZ8SIm5w%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) as alternatives for displaced traders.  It was also specifically referred to as able to [supply 38 affordable units](https://twitter.com/elephant_petit/status/1081278395504197633) when the Castle Square facility was appoved back in January.

Unlike the other 3 sites, Elephant Park is under Lendlease control, not Delancey or Southwark, so the suspicion is that it has no desire to help its competitor, or Southwark, relocate traders, notwithstanding the [_'imagination, empathy and dedication'_](https://www.lendlease.com/uk/projects/elephant-park/?id=3c8e138c-140a-4268-8cba-199afaec168d) it claims to be bringing to the Elephant & Castle.

##Predictable debacle

This was an entirely predictable debacle.  Objectors have consistently pointed out that Delancey's evolving relocation strategy simply did not provide enough space to accommodate all the traders who wish to stay at the Elephant.  

In the summer of 2017 Southwark estimated that there were about 130 independent businesses, occupying 4005sqm within the 'red-line' of the develoment (excluding the Hannibal House office space), as [cited by Latin Elephant](https://twitter.com/LatinElephant/status/1081169626590048258).  Latin Elephant calculated that all available space, including Elephant Park (and throwing in pitches in East St market, nearly a mile down the road), could accommodate 84 businesses on 2,263 sqm -  and not much more than half the floorspace required and leaving at least 38 eligible buinesses in the cold.




Wishful thinking - officer's report 
As Latin Elephant objected back in March 2018 the amount of affordable retail space available falls far short of the 4000 sqm  https://latinelephant.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2018-03-09-LE-Objection-Deferred-Appl.pdf

Officer assurances 12 Dec 2018 https://twitter.com/elephant_petit/status/1081278395504197633.  identifies 80 businesses,

Southwark and Delancey have responded by underestimating the number of traders and with wishful thinking.
