title: Shopping Centre redevelopment - Delancy tries again
---
## Delancey returns to the planning commmittee

Elephant shopping centre owners and developers Delancey will be hoping it is third time lucky when Southwark's planning committee considers their application for redeveloping the centre centre on 3 July.  The committee chose not approve the application at two meetings in January and the decison was further deferred because of local elections in May.  

Delancey's initial failure, though, was the result of a concerted campaign which united shopping centre traders, the local Latin American community, staff and students from the London College of Communication,  local housing campaigners and local councillors.  There were over 900 objections.

Delancey has used the time since to make some modest improvements.  The number of social rented units was increased from 33 to 74 and within the last week to 116.  The units will be owned and managed by Southwark Council, not a private sector registered provider as previously proposed.  Interim retail units are also being built to accommodate at least some of the displaced traders, on Castle Sq, just over the railway from the centre.  Any trader within the 'red-line'of the development will be eligible for support from the relocation strategy.  A 'cluster' of affordable retail and affordable space is proposed for Pastor St, behind the London College of Communication.  There is also a qualified commitment to lease a proportion of the proposed leisure floorspace to a bingo operator (the Palaces bing0 and bowling alley in the centre are major attractions in the area)

These improvements are valuablefor some.  However for the traders it is all too little, too late. Local charity (Latin Elephant)[http://latinelephant.org/] reckons there are 150 migrant and ethnic businesess at the Elephant They have been informed that they will have to leave the centre in by March 2019, regardlesshey are still not enough though to make the scheme acceptable and the planning committee should reject
