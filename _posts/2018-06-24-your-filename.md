The units will be owned and managed by Southwark Council, not a private sector registered provider as previously proposed.  Interim retail units are also being built to accommodate at least some of the displaced traders, on Castle Sq, just over the railway from the centre.  Any trader within the 'red-line'of the development will be eligible for support from the relocation strategy.  A 'cluster' of affordable retail and affordable space is proposed for Pastor St, behind the London College of Communication.
