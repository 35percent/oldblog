Cllr Williams has claimed that the regeneration is paying for the new Elephant and Castle leisure centre. We show that this is not the case:

## S106 contributions
Go through S106 agreements for Elephant & Castle and sum up the total S106 
contributions for 

 * Health/GP services
 * Education
 * Leisure

Show how pitiful these are in comparison to the total new number of residents 
(ca. 15,000)

Explain how leisure centre and elephant tube upgrade paid out of HRA account, 
i.e. money from council rents that would normally be spent on upkeep and 
maintenance of the borough's estates. These now left to rot. 

Land value uplift should finance the public infrastructure required as a result 
of increased density development. Instead what is happening is that publically 
funded infrastructure is helping developers line their pockets.

## GLA chield yield
GLA has a calculator to calculate the potential child yield from a development: [https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/planning/implementing-london-plan/supplementary-planning-guidance/play-and-informal](https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/planning/implementing-london-plan/supplementary-planning-guidance/play-and-informal)

This article by Olly Wainwright contains a link to study showing that granting planning permission gifts Â£9bn to developers every year: https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/may/31/housing-manifestos-conservatives-labour-lib-dems-homes
