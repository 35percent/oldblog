title: Traders denied space on Elephant Park
---
##

Back in 2013 when the controversial Heygate redevelopment was approved, a promise was made to the planning committee that the redeveloped estate (now 'Elephant Park') would provide affordable retail space for traders displaced from the demolition of the shopping centre. This promise was enshrined in the S106 legal agreement signed with developer Lendlease:

Last week we revealed that no shopping centre traders have been allocated any of the 8 completed units at Elephant Park. Now we can reveal that at least 3 shopping centre traders have applied and been rejected - Miko's restaurant, JZ Mobile and Pricebusters.

No doubt Lendlease doesn't want the likes of these low-brow shops sullying its posh new development.
