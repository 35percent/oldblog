## Council put on defensive by fierce criticism

Southwark Council has been obliged to issue a lengthy statement in defence of the treatment 

Southwark

## Lost but not forgotten

While Southwark has been forced to turn its attention to the remaining traders, it would be easy to forget the traders, services and leisure amenities that have already been lost to the regeneration.  Latin Elephant research shows that there were 130 traders in January 2018; now we have about ninety left, with only about half reallocated.  Forty or so have already gone, and have fallen out of Southwark's reckoning, forced to leave, as footfall and business declined, wearied beyond hope by the whole 'regeneration' process.

Amongst these are the Palaces bingo hall, described as Britain's second largest, with its large customer base in the BAME community; the Palaces Bowling alley, much loved by local students; the many small office businesses in Hannibal House, just above the centre.In Southwark's happy reality they no longer exist and so their loss does not count.

The true story about the shopping centre redevelopment is the same as it was for the Heygate estate regeneration - Southwark Council threw its lot in with the developers, Lendlease and Delancey, and what would happen the people who actually lived and worked at the Elephant has been an afterthought.
