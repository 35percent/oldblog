Southwark Council has issued a [lengthy statement](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/regeneration/elephant-and-castle?chapter=13) in defence of its treatment of the shopping centre traders, as around [40 face the loss of their livelihood](https://latinelephant.org/displaced-traders-with-no-relocation/#Sayed), when the centre closes on 24 September, according to research by local charity Latin Elephant.  

The statement says that 45 traders have been relocated, with 31 'remaining'.  These 'remaining' unallocated traders, with nowhere to go, have received £3000 each.  They will receive a second payment of an unspecified amount _'near the closure of the shopping centre'_ ; given the number of traders and the total size of the Business Transition Grant fund (£200k) this is likely to be about another £3000.

Southwark also say that unallocated traders _'are able to claim from the relocation fund'_ but this will be of little use if they have no new premises.

Other than this the statement details various generic _'business support'_ measures, such as acccess to websites and databases and advice from _'independent business and relocation advisor'_ Tree Shepherd (remote access only).

The inadequacy of these _'business support'_ measures barely needs stating; if they were of any use nearly half of the remaining traders would not be without new premises.  Our webpage [E&C Traders with nowhere to go](http://35percent.org/traders-expelled-by-regeneration/) tells the stories 6 of the unallocated traders, who have been at the centre for between eight and 20 years each (a total of nearly a hundred years between them). They are all experienced traders who would otherwise be continuing in their trade, but for the regeneration.  They deserve something more than ineffectual promises of help, with a derisory £6000 to see them on their way, come 24 September.

## The Relocation Fund

While Southwark says _'the Relocation Fund (£647,835) has been available for eligible traders ...from February 2020'_ traders have not in fact been getting the money they need because Southwark, Delancey and Tree Shepherd have shown no urgency in resolving issues around the costs of fit-outs and lease and rent arrangements.  Southwark says these are being _'currently'_ resolved, when there is not much more than a month to go before closure.  There is also no on-the-ground practical help, of the kind Tree Shepherd should be providing; this can be excused to an extent by the Covid crisis, but that does not help the traders.

Each relocation payment will be based on the size of the new premises; averaged out it would be £14,396 per trader - less than a tenth of Tree Shepherd's fee of £192,900 for administering the whole exercise.  The payments are only designed to meet actual relocation costs - they do not include any compensation for loss of business, premises, disturbance etc.

The total amount in the Relocation Fund is derisory in comparison to the Delancey's anticipated profit of £148.4m. Southwark's statement attempts to address this, saying _'Delancey have long agreed to supplement the relocation fund on a case by case basis'_.  This turns out to be Delancey's hardship fund. This is to be awarded entirely at Delancy's discretion and traders must first consider raising loans from family, friends or elsewhere, before making an application.  We presume that this is to ensure that only the deserving get the money - an alternative method would be to simply assess the actual costs of relocating and paying anything above the paltry amount currently on offer (Delancey has also offered the helpful advice that traders could become Uber drivers).

## Statement highlights

Several other parts of Southwark's statement stand out, with one in particular being for ness;

_For many smaller traders this is an opportunity to grow and develop their business._

Even if we are being charitable, there cannot have been any point since the demolition and redevelopment of the shopping centre was first proposed three years ago when this was true; it certainly is not now.

_The council is committed to enabling the largest possible number of existing businesses to remain in the area_ 

This empty statement takes us to the heart of the problem.  If Southwark was genuinely committed to keeping the largest number of businesses in the area it would not have approved a planning application that did not guarantee that.  As we note above Southwark planning was happy to recommend approval for an application that did not have one of the main relocation sites (Castle Square) and no fully realised relocation strategy.

_Unfortunately there were always going to be traders that were not able to be offered a unit in
the relocation spaces listed owing to space restrictions._

This is true, but Southwark ignored the fact when Latin Elephant pointed it out in their objection to the Delancey planning application back in to 2018 [OR851].  In other words, the shortfall wasn't so unfortunate that it prevented Southwark from approving the application.  It is worth adding that Southwark, while fully aware that  _'Market stall operators may experience temporary or permanent closure or disruption to business operations, financial or other barriers to re-opening at the new development or in the wider area'_, they did not go out of their way to broadcast the fact and certainly not to the market traders. OR 169. 270618 

851. Only 2,050sqm of affordable retail space would be available for immediate relocation,
and 4,005sqm is needed;


235. It is not proposed that there would be an automatic right of return for existing businesses operating at the site, and this has been raised as a concern in public consultation responses....it is likely that some businesses will either cease trading on or before closure of the shopping centre, or relocate to other parts of the opportunity area, the borough, or beyond. OR 270618 - check s106

This is not true.  
## Credit to Southwark?

Southwark's statement lists the various measures that mitigate the traders'plight somewhat, without saying that it was quite happy for the development to go ahead without most of them.  The relocation fund was in place, but there was no temporary premises at Castle Sq, no transition fund for unallocated traders and no Trader's Panel (and no real socail rented housing) when the planning application first went to planning committee, late 2017.  Delancey had made its opinion of the traders clear, saying _‘…some existing retailers in the area are benefitting from disproportionately low levels of rent for such a central London location and it may not be financially viable for them to survive in the wider area over the longer term’_.  Consequently Delancey did not intend to provide a relocation strategy, until after it got its planning permission.  Southwark were quite content with this and recommended the application for approval, nonetheless.  Concessions, such as Castle Sq, the £200,000 transition fund, the Traders panel (and real social rented housing) were only hard-won subsequently by the traders and campaigners, including some local councillors.

## Lost but not forgotten

While Southwark has been forced to turn its attention to the remaining traders, it would be easy to forget the traders, services and leisure amenities that have already been lost to the regeneration.  Latin Elephant research shows that there were 130 traders in January 2018; now we have about ninety left, with only about half reallocated.  Forty or so have already gone, and have fallen out of Southwark's reckoning, forced to leave, as footfall and business declined, wearied beyond hope by the whole 'regeneration' process.

Amongst these are the Palaces bingo hall, described as Britain's second largest, with its large customer base in the BAME community; the Palaces Bowling alley, much loved by local students; the Coronet cinema; the many small office businesses in Hannibal House, just above the centre.In Southwark's happy reality they no longer exist and so their loss does not count.

The true story about the shopping centre redevelopment is the same as it was for the Heygate estate regeneration - Southwark Council threw its lot in with the developers, Lendlease and Delancey, and what would happen the people who actually lived and worked at the Elephant has been an afterthought.

What do Southwark need to do now

There is now less than a month to go before the shopping centre closes.  ; 

Pay the unallocated traders the outstanding amounts of the Business Transition Grant immediately 
Pay the allocated traders the money they need to fit-out their new premises immediately
