The [g15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G15_%28housing_associations%29) – who represent London’s largest housing associations – has launched a report which documents 35 of its estate regeneration projects. It highlights the importance of estate regeneration in solving the capital’s housing crisis and identifies what is required to deliver more. Notting Hill Housing Trust is a key player in the g15 group and the report was also authored with the help of Southwark's Director of Housing & Modernisation Gerri Scott[^1]. 

The report repeats all of the usual right wing arguments against council estates: create mixed communities; replace poor quality housing; address social deprivation etc, etc.

The report goes on to make 5 recommendations to policy makers for furthering estate renewal programmes. One of these asks for fewer restrictions over rent levels:

This echoes Notting Hill CEO Kate Davies' call for less rent control in the [policy paper](http://www.centreforsocialjustice.org.uk/UserStorage/pdf/Pdf%20reports/HousingPoverty.pdf) she co-authored with Iain Duncan-Smith for the CSJ think tank.
