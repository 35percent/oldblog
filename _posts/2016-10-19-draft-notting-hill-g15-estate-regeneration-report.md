## Battle for the Aylesbury is on
Secretary of State has confirmed that he will contest the Council's appeal of 
his Aylesbury CPO decision. We submitted our [response] to the Council's [shaky 
grounds of appeal] last week. Following an impressive kick-start to our 
crowd-funding campaign, the Aylesbury leaseholders have been able to instruct a 
barrister to make initial submissions. We'll be further fundraising for them to 
go all the way to the hearing. 

Govt rows back on Cameron's pledge

Aylesbury DPA FOI


## Barratts chief arrested for fiddling contracts awards
Southwark has made a big deal of the fact that the Aylesbury estate is being 
redeveloped by a Notting Hill Housin Trust, a 'non-profit' housing association.  
It has kept very quiet about the fact that Notting Hill's _'developer partner'_ 
for the scheme is Britain's xx largest private developer Barratt Homes and that 
Barratt will be both building and selling all of the redeveloped estate's 1800 
private market homes.

Mention also Blackfriars Circus and how they are described in the DPA.

Southwark the tenants' friend? - really?





 *Demolishing 2,200 council homes 
 *Replacing them with 'affordable' housing 
 *Diverting £££Ms of funds from other estates to shore up NHHT's finances
 *Forcing council tenants through the misery of Homesearch
 *Denying those on the housing waiting list a better chance of a council home

These are the losers, here are the winners:

NHHT, Barratt Homes

NHHT profit - where does it go? into building new 'social housing' or paying of its historic £700m debt?



The [g15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G15_%28housing_associations%29) – who represent London’s largest housing associations – has launched a report which documents 35 of its estate regeneration projects. It highlights the importance of estate regeneration in solving the capital’s housing crisis and identifies what is required to deliver more. Notting Hill Housing Trust is a key player in the g15 group and the report was also authored with the help of Southwark's Director of Housing & Modernisation Gerri Scott[^1]. 

The report repeats all of the usual right wing arguments against council estates: create mixed communities; replace poor quality housing; address social deprivation etc, etc.

The report goes on to make 5 recommendations to policy makers for furthering estate renewal programmes. One of these asks for fewer restrictions over rent levels:

This echoes Notting Hill CEO Kate Davies' call for less rent control in the [policy paper](http://www.centreforsocialjustice.org.uk/UserStorage/pdf/Pdf%20reports/HousingPoverty.pdf) she co-authored with Iain Duncan-Smith for the CSJ think tank.

## St James Place
St James Place estate is a good example of what happens when Notting Hill is free to sent rent levels without restrictions. Rent hikes of xx have resulted in a spate of evictions. http://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/housing-association-slammed-nightmare-scenario-eviction-threat-bermondseys-st-james-estate/

## Aylesbury regen FAQ

### do you know where I could find a basic outline of the finances of the Aylesbury regeneration?

Some of the basic financials are laid out here: http://35percent.org/aylesbury-estate/#bridging-the-viability-gap
and in this blog post: http://35percent.org/2016-09-26-council-appeals-aylesbury-cpo-decision/#the-business-case-for-a-moratorium

### I think I've understood from your posts that you're saying Southwark Council have said it would cost them £150 million to decant residents and knock down the estate. Is that for the whole estate or just the first development phase?

The whole estate
 
### And you're saying that it will end up being much more than that, right?

£47m of this has already been spent and a further £52m committed before the first development site has even been demolished.
See this blog post for more info on these figures: http://35percent.org/2016-09-26-council-appeals-aylesbury-cpo-decision/#the-business-case-for-a-moratorium

### Are there figures out there on how much Notting Hill plans to spend on building the new blocks?

Construction and associated costs are estimated at £888m in the viability figures we obtained via FOI. It gets a bit more complicated because Notting Hill has an agreement with developers Barratt homes who are actually the ones building the new homes. I understand from the redacted Development Partnership Agreement that Barratt will foot most of the construction costs in return for being able to keep half of the sales revenue on the sale of the private units up to an agreed price per square ft (£451 per square ft).
 
### And what about the land, do Southwark just sell it to Notting Hill or do they keep owning it?
Need to look at this and the explanations in the closed Cabinet report as to who gets what from the deal. My initial understanding is that Southwark gives NHHT the land, NHHT then lets Barratt build the new homes on it. In return for building the new homes Barratt gets to keep 50% of the sales revenue (up to a level of £451 per sqft). What about the affordable units though? What does the report say about these?


Southwark is selling the entire estate to Notting Hill. The Council will receive payments from Notting Hill in return for selling the land but these will be dependent on the viability of each individual phase; i.e. after each phase is completed the total construction costs (plus a 21% profit margin for Notting Hill - [included as a cost]) are deducted from the total sales revenue, and whatever is left over the Council receives as a land receipt for the sale of the Land.
The Council also has a profit share agreement with Notting Hill, whereby it receives 50% of the sales profit if sales exceed a given benchmark (£472 per square ft).
