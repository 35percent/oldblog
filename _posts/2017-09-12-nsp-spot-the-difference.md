Southwark Council has just released the final 'preferred option' version of its borough-wide planning policy that will govern development in the borough during the next 15 years.

It has been consulting on this new policy since 2014 and the [first draft version](http://www.2.southwark.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/12867/new_southwark_plan_preferred_option_consultation_version_web) was published in October 2015. This first October 2015 was actually rather good; it set down a number of red lines that developers must comply with and was clear on affordable housing requirements.

In June this year it published its second and final ['amended preferred option' version](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/assets/attach/3658/NSP%20Full%20New%20and%20Revised%20Policies%20optimised.pdf) which we have discovered drops many of the safeguards surrouding affordable housing delivery that were contained in the first version, and has inserted a number of loopholes for developers to boot. 

The first of which is policy DM1 which has dropped the requirement for affordable housing to be calculated in terms of floorspace and inserted the qualification 'subject to viability'. The consequences of this will be obvious to developers who already [run rings around the Council with their viability assessments](http://35percent.org/collated-viability-assessments/) and will be glad to calculate affordable housing using habitable rooms where difference in room sizes can be manipulated according to the developer's advantage.

The same section of the original draft policy contained further detail on the 35% policy as a 'minimum' requirement that it asserts as 'viable and deliverable'. It went on to require a 'full viability appraisal' in the event this cannot be achieved and vowed that the calculation methodology of any financial contribution accepted in lieu will ensure that there _"cannot be a financial advantage to the developer from not providing the affordable housing on site"_. The section also made reference to the Council's committment to build 9,500 new Council homes between 2018 and 2033.
This entire section has been deleted from the final draft.

The following paragraph contained in the original draft policy, set out the hierarchy of affordable housing provision and required a cash in-lieu payment where on-site provision was not possible. It also set out the method for calulating this in-lieu payment. The final 'preferred' version of the policy has deleted this paragraph in its entirety and is silent on in-lieu provision.

Similarly, the section in the original draft policy setting out requirements for small developments of nine homes or less has been completely deleted:

*Affordable housing requirements for small developments deleted from final policy draft*

The original policy draft contained this strongly worded paragraph asserting that _"We will not accept affordable rent as it fails to meet the housing needs of Southwark's residents in need of affordable housing"._ This has also now been deleted from the final draft.

These last-minute amendments to a planning policy that will govern the borough's development for the next 15 years are a kick in the teeth to our campaign. They're also a set back for other groups and residents who have been campaigning against the current (Labour) administration's developer-led top-down planning model.

Instead of using this as an opportunity to set down some red lines for developers seeking to avoid planning obligations, it has set down a red carpet.

The three words 'subject to viability' inserted into the final policy draft, will undoubtedly be quoted by developers in hundreds of planning applications over the next 15 years to come. They will be the lasting legacy of an administration hell bent on 'regeneration' and 'attracting investment' in whatever shiny high-rise form it takes; an administration desperate and grateful for whatever crumbs it receives in planning gain, so that it can continue pursuing its needless and highly costly demolition schemes elsewhere... bla bla

The same caveat was inserted into the [local area plan for the Old Kent Rd opportunity area](http://35percent.org/2016-11-21-old-kent-road-aap-loopholes/) last year. Not one of Southwark's 48 Labour councillors objected. Labour values?

For years our Labour councillors have been blaming the Tories and Tory policy for the housing crisis. This is one example of where they could have made a difference by using local policy to force developers to provide a proportion of housing affordable to local people. They have failed miserably.
