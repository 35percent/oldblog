title: Southwark substitutes red lines with the red carpet
subtitle: Subject to viability loophole inserted into borough's new planning policy
---

Southwark Council has just released the final 'preferred option' version of its borough-wide planning policy, the local plan, that will govern development in the borough during the next 15 years.

It has been consulting on this new policy since 2014 and the [first draft version](http://www.2.southwark.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/12867/new_southwark_plan_preferred_option_consultation_version_web) was published in October 2015. This first October 2015 draft stuck to the status-quo of the current local plan, the Core Strategy; it set down a number of red lines that developers must comply with and was relatively clear on affordable housing requirements.

In June this year it published its second and final ['amended preferred option' version](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/assets/attach/3658/NSP%20Full%20New%20and%20Revised%20Policies%20optimised.pdf), drops many of the safeguards surrouding affordable housing delivery that were contained in the first version, and has inserted a number of loopholes for developers to boot. 

The first of which is policy DM1 which has dropped the requirement for affordable housing to be calculated in terms of floorspace and inserted the qualification 'subject to viability'. The consequences of this will be obvious to developers who already [run rings around the Council with their viability assessments](http://35percent.org/collated-viability-assessments/) and will be glad to calculate affordable housing using habitable rooms where they can continue to exploit the double counting loophole in the Council's existing affordable housing SPD[^1].

The same section of the original draft policy contained further detail on the 35% policy as a 'minimum' requirement that it asserts as 'viable and deliverable'. It went on to require a 'full viability appraisal' in the event this cannot be achieved and vowed that the calculation methodology of any financial contribution accepted in lieu will ensure that there _"cannot be a financial advantage to the developer from not providing the affordable housing on site"_. The section also made reference to the Council's committment to build 9,500 new Council homes between 2018 and 2033.
This entire section has been deleted from the final draft.

The following paragraph contained in the original draft policy, set out the hierarchy of affordable housing provision and required a cash in-lieu payment where on-site provision was not possible. It also set out the method for calulating this in-lieu payment. The final 'preferred' version of the policy has deleted this paragraph in its entirety and is silent on in-lieu provision.

*Paragraph setting out requirement for payments in lieu deleted entirely*

Similarly, the section in the original draft policy setting out requirements for small developments of nine homes or less has been completely deleted:

*Affordable housing requirements for small developments deleted from final policy draft*

The original policy draft contained this strongly worded paragraph asserting that _"We will not accept affordable rent as it fails to meet the housing needs of Southwark's residents in need of affordable housing"._ This has also now been deleted from the final draft.

*Original text deleted from final policy draft*

These last-minute amendments to a planning policy that will govern the borough's development for the next 15 years are a kick in the teeth to our campaign. They're also a set back for other groups and residents who have been campaigning against the current (Labour) administration's developer-led top-down planning model.

Instead of using this as an opportunity to set down some red lines for developers seeking to avoid planning obligations, it has set down a red carpet.

We [blogged recently](http://35percent.org/2017-10-02-council-leader-peter-john-alternative-facts/) about the pitifully low levels of affordable housing being delivered under this administration. We also [blogged last year](http://35percent.org/2016-11-21-old-kent-road-aap-loopholes/) about a viability loophole being inserted into the Council's planning policy for the Old Kent Road opportunity area:

This latest concession to developers will do nothing but fuel further speculation bla bla bla.. the housing crisis... 
For years our Labour councillors have been blaming the Tories and Tory policy for the housing crisis. This is one example of where they could have made a difference by using local policy to force developers to provide a proportion of housing affordable to local people. They have failed miserably.  

Unlike any of Southwark's 48 Labour Councillors, we have objected to these 'subject to viability' policy proposals. You can view our [full submission here](http://35percent.org/img/EANComments_FinalNSP.pdf).
