There has been lost of interest in the Aylesbury CPO. It has been subject of much discussion in the legal world and heralded as a test case - right to a community etc.

It will be a test case to see if Councils are permitted to do the following:

1. Hold a ballot asking residents if they want refurb or demolition and then proceeding with demolition despite 73% of residents voting against it.

2. Offer rehousing options to leaseholders (like-for-like swap) and then subsequently withdrawn them.

3. Manipulate the numbers so that a scheme looks like it is providing more affordable housing than it actually will. (separate blog post for this on hr definition)
