subtitle: First major Old Kent Road application goes to committee
---
The first of the very large planning applications lining up to take advantage of the proposed Old Kent Rd Opportunity Area goes to Southwark's planning committee tomorrow (Tues 9 Oct).  It is for a mixed-use scheme that would include 1152 homes, with 40.5% affordable housing, two-thirds of which will be social rented.  A residents' gym and sports hall and new 'pocket park' are also promised. The scheme is proposed by a [joint venture](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/10733947/charges) between A2Dominion Housing association and recently-formed developer Avanton Ltd, which is [chaired by former defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/michael-fallon-takes-on-property-job-with-avanton-nvgttjprt).

Despite the affordable housing offer, the application has nonetheless excited much passionate opposition.  The site is a SIL - site of strategic industrial land and the loss of industrial workspace is contrary to the local plan. The proposed development has 3 towers, one of 48 storeys, another of 40 storeys.  The [VitalOKR group](https://www.vitalokr.com/), a coalition of residents, businesses and community groups, have objected to the loss of industrial land and impact on jobs.  Thirteen businesses and a church currently occupy the site. 

One of the businesses ['Constantine Ltd'](http://www.const.co.uk) employs 130 local people and provides logistics to clients such as the Natural History museum and the Tate. It has lodged a [formal objection](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!4ZMeZ3p9kp4Z69c9aEnicQ%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) to the planning application, claiming that the developer has made little effort to engage with them about alternative premises and surrender of their lease which runs for another 10 years.

Objectors also point out that, while 40% affordable housing appears generous, the treshold for affordable housing is 50% for SIL sites in the Mayor's draft New London Plan.  Local residents along Canal Grove Cottages fear a loss of light, and the detrimental impact on the local environment of a scheme that is nearly four times denser than the local plan allows (2,701 habitable rooms per hectare against a maximum 700h hbr per hectare)[^1]. Related to this there is no information on whether the 1,152 dwellings proposed comply with the BRE's minimum daylight requirements. The Design Review Panel, which reviews all major developments on Southwark Council's behalf, has serious resevations about the architectural quality of the scheme, and does not believe that it is of [the exemplary standard](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!zwzcnVTSKTErmZbXhytUAA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) that would justify the greater density. 

Ojectors also believe that developers and Southwark are getting ahead of themselves.  The Opportunity Area (and accompanying area action plan) has not completed its own progress through the planning system; a public inquiry that examines the Opportunity Area's merits and the competing development claims on the land is not due to be heard until the new year.

## Enough affordable housing?

The 35% Campaign is always pleased to see a development that offers more affordable and social rented housing than the local plan stipulates, but where more affordable housing is required, and it is 50% under the emerging, draft London Plan, that should be delivered.  

Closer inspection raises some other concerns.

There is an ambiguity over the social rented housing; the application and [officer's report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!S%2bIqqCm1W5sBBPLbS6aFWQ%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) refers to social rented housing, yet the [GLA Stage 1 report](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/PAWS/media_id_414643/ruby_triangle_sandgate_street_report.pdf)   refers to same units as 'affordable rent', which can be up to 80% market rent.  The usual GLA Stage 2 report is not available at the time of going to committee.
The affordable housing provider A2Dominiun also rings an alarm bell.  They featured in our successful complaint to the Ombudsman about tenure swutching, where affordable rent was substituted in developments where social rent had been approved, in this case the [Colorama development](http://35percent.org/2016-02-16-the-affordable-housing-mirage/) in Blackfriars. A2Dominium, was also subject to a planning breach notification from Southwark Council for a development at 166-178 Camberwell Rd and the site has stood half-finished since 2015.

## Profit vs affordable housing - what's reasonable?

There is an unresolved dispute about the reasonable level of profit to be assumed in the viability assessment for the private housing.  This could have a bearing on the final amount of affordable housing, to be calculated by a late viability review mechanism.  Crudely, the higher the profit the less left for affordable housing. The developer wants 20% GDV (Gross Development Value), while the Council's [independent assessors' report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!7xk%2fKitlYCgrfYEbtqBRDA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) argues that this is too high and that 17.5% GDV is reasonable. This is backed up by the Council's own [viability study](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/assets/attach/1937/Old%20Kent%20Road%20viability%20study%202016.pdf) commissioned for the OKR AAP, which assumes a developer profit margin of 18% (para 4.39).

In cash terms Southwark's assessor gives £73.8m as a reasonable profit for the private housing.  According to their [own viability assessment](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!oY11bGc7aC6RJOzPXGXlpQ%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d), where the profits are listed as 'miscellaneous fees', the developer has a profit target of £92.21m for the private housing, and an overall profit assumption of £101.36m, when profits for affordable housing and commercial premises are added in.

## Viable or not viable?

A peculiarity of the Southwark assessor's appraisal of the viability assessment is that it concludes _'that the proposed scheme would not be viable with a 35% affordable housing offer..., but that ‘stand back’ analysis (using evidence of local land sales with planning permission to ascertain a price per habitable room) indicates that it would be deliverable'._  This raises the question of how useful the viability assessment can be, if its conclusion can be discarded and an alternative 'stand back' analysis, with a different conclusion, is depended on instead.

Similarly, the caveat that '_the sensitivity analysis applied in this review also shows that relatively small changes in key variables would result in a viable scheme_' illustrates the uncertainties surrrounding viability assessments [^2]
