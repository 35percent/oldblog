## Ruby Tuesday

The first of the very large planning applications lining up to take advantage of the proposed Old Kent Rd Opportunity Area goes to Southwark's planning committee on Tues 9 Oct.  It is for a mixed-use scheme that would include 1152 homes, with 40.5% affordable housing. (Other bits - retail, business, leisure)

Despite the affordble housing offer, the application has nonetheless excited much passionate opposition.  The site is a SIL - site of strategic industrial land and the loss will be contrary to the local plan.  Thirteen businesses and a church currently occupy the site, with about 130 employees.  The proposed development has 3 towers, one of 48 storeys another of 40 storeys.  The Old Kent People, a coalition of residents, businesses and community groups and Vital OKR, a business group, have objected because of the loss of industrial land.  They also point out that the treshold for affordable housing, which allows applications to pass more easily through the system, is 50% for SIL sites in the Mayor's draft New London Plan. (review mechanism).  (Canal Grove Cottages).

In addition, objectors believe that developers and Southwark are getting ahead of themselves.  The opportunity areea (and area acion plan) has not completed its own progress through the planning system and the public inquiry, (Examination in Public) that examnes its merits and the competing cliams on land is not due to be heard until the new year. the Old Kent Rd planning application is premature and should be refused on the basis that it
cannot be decided until the New Southwark Plan (“the NSP”) and the Old Kent
Road Area Action Plan (“the AAP”) have been formally adopted;
.
The application should be refused because the mix of unit sizes and tenure
proposed does not correspond with Southwark’s housing need, as reported in the
South East London Strategic Housing Market Assessment (“the SHMA”),
Strategic Policy 7 of the Core Strategy or policy H7 of the draft new London Plan;
.
As the site is located in with an Opportunity Area and Strategic Industrial
Location, the threshold approach of 35% affordable housing is not appropriate for
the site. Draft London Plan Policy H6 sets an affordable housing threshold of 50%
for industrial land;
.
The proposals do not accord with current policy relating to tall buildings. The Old
Kent Road is not identified in the Core Strategy as a location where tall buildings
can be built and the design is not of the exemplary standard required.  Review panel
