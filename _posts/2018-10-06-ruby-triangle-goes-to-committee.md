## Ruby Tuesday

The first of the very large planning applications lining up to take advantage of the proposed Old Kent Rd Opportunity Area goes to Southwark's planning committee on Tues 9 Oct.  It is for a mixed-use scheme that would include 1152 homes, with 40.5% affordable housing, two-thirds of which will be social rented.  A sports hall, gym and new park are also promised.)

Despite the affordble housing offer, the application has nonetheless excited much passionate opposition.  The site is a SIL - site of strategic industrial land and the loss will be contrary to the local plan.  Thirteen businesses and a church currently occupy the site, with about 130 employees.  The proposed development has 3 towers, one of 48 storeys another of 40 storeys.  The Old Kent People, a coalition of residents, businesses and community groups and Vital OKR, a business group, have objected because of the loss of industrial land.  They also point out that the treshold for affordable housing, which allows applications to pass more easily through the system, is 50% for SIL sites in the Mayor's draft New London Plan. (review mechanism). Local residents along Canal Grove Cottages fear a loss of light, ans a detrimentl impact on the local environment from height and density of the development.

The Design Review Panel, which reviews all major developments on Southwark Council's behalf, also serious resevations about the architectural quality, size 

In addition, objectors believe that developers and Southwark are getting ahead of themselves.  The opportunity areea (and area action plan) has not completed its own progress through the planning system and the public inquiry, (Examination in Public) that examnes its merits and the competing cliams on land is not due to be heard until the new year.

The 35% Camapign is always pleased to see a development that offers more afffordable and social rented housing than the local plan requires.  Closer inspection, though, raises some concerns.  Where more affordable housing is required, 50% under the emerging, draft London Plan, that should be delivered (the late review mechanism Southwark propose is an inadequate substitute).

There is also an ambiguity over the social rented housing; thoughout the application and officer's report it is referred to as such, yet the GLA Stage 1 report refers to same units as 'affordable rent', which can be up to 80% market rent.  The affordable housing provider A2Dominiun also rings an alarm bell.  They featured in our successful complaint to the Ombudsman about tenure swutching, where affordable rent was substituted in developments where social rent had been approved, in this case the Colorama developemt in Blackfriars,  A2Dominium are also embroliedin a planning breach row with Southwark Council for another development at 66-178 Cmaberwell Rd, which stands half-finished in the meantime.



.
As the site is located in with an Opportunity Area and Strategic Industrial
Location, the threshold approach of 35% affordable housing is not appropriate for
the site. Draft London Plan Policy H6 sets an affordable housing threshold of 50%
for industrial land;
.
The proposals do not accord with current policy relating to tall buildings. The Old
Kent Road is not identified in the Core Strategy as a location where tall buildings
can be built and the design is not of the exemplary standard required.  Review panel
