subtitle: First major Old Kent Road application goes to committee

---
The first of the very large planning applications lining up to take advantage of the proposed Old Kent Rd Opportunity Area goes to Southwark's planning committee tomorrow (Tues 9 Oct).  It is for a mixed-use scheme that would include 1152 homes, with 40.5% affordable housing, two-thirds of which would supposedly be social rented.  A residents' gym and sports hall and new 'pocket park' are also promised. The scheme is proposed by a [joint venture](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/10733947/charges) between [A2Dominion Housing association](http://www.a2dominion.co.uk) and recently-formed developer [Avanton Ltd](http://www.avanton.co.uk), which is [chaired by former defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/michael-fallon-takes-on-property-job-with-avanton-nvgttjprt).

Despite the affordable housing offer, the application has nonetheless excited much passionate opposition.  The site is [designated as a SIL - Strategic Industrial Location](https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/planning/london-plan/current-london-plan/london-plan-chapter-two-londons-places/policy-3) and the loss of industrial workspace is contrary to the local plan. The proposed development has 3 towers, one of 48 storeys, another of 40 storeys.  The [VitalOKR group](https://www.vitalokr.com/), a coalition of residents, businesses and community groups, have objected to the loss of industrial land and impact on jobs.  Thirteen businesses and a church currently occupy the Ruby Triangle site. 

Among the businesses is a data management company that [lists](https://www.dajon.co.uk/clients) both Southwark Council and the GLA amongst its clients. Another businesses ['Constantine Ltd'](http://www.const.co.uk) employs 130 local people and provides fine-art logistics to clients such as the Natural History museum and the Tate. It has lodged a [formal objection](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!4ZMeZ3p9kp4Z69c9aEnicQ%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) to the planning application, claiming that the developer has made little effort to engage with them about alternative premises and surrender of their lease which runs for another 10 years.

Objectors also point out that, while 40% affordable housing appears generous, the threshold for affordable housing is 50% for SIL sites in the Mayor's draft New London Plan. Local residents in the neighbouring Canal Grove Cottages fear loss of daylight, and the detrimental impact on the local environment of a scheme that is nearly four times denser than the local plan allows (2,701 habitable rooms per hectare against a maximum 700h hbr per hectare)[^1]. Related to this there is no information on whether any of the 1,152 dwellings proposed comply with the BRE's minimum daylight requirements - a requirement of Southwark's planning policy[^2]. In its [report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!zwzcnVTSKTErmZbXhytUAA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) to planning committee, Southwark's Design Review Panel (DRP) (which reviews all major developments on Southwark Council's behalf) raised concerns about the lack of sunlight/daylight analysis and expressed serious reservations about the architectural quality of the scheme in general, not least because a very high proportion (50%) of the new homes will be single aspect (with 10% north facing). The DRP said that it is _"also concerned that part of the ‘green heart’ that is being proposed as a key public benefit of the scheme, falls outside the site boundary"_. Indeed, the [site ownership boundary plan](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!lHNsESl4052kei4QPoSJoQ%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) submitted by the developer shows that more than half of the proposed 'pocket park' is located on land that it doesn't own. As such, there is no guarantee that it will be delivered.

![](http://35percent.org/img/rubytriangleownership.png)

The DRP sums up the situation well, by concluding that it cannot endorse the scheme in its current form and stating that _"the panel fear that the AAP will be used to justify opportunistic and piecemeal over development of small sites, with each proposal leaving future developments to provide the public realm strategy and improvements that are required to support such high density schemes."_

This echoes objectors fears that developers and Southwark are getting ahead of themselves.  The Opportunity Area (and accompanying area action plan) has not completed its own progress through the planning system; a public inquiry (EiP) that examines the Opportunity Area's merits and makes recommendations for amendments is not due to be heard until the new year.

## Enough affordable housing?

The 35% Campaign is always pleased to see a development that offers more affordable and social rented housing than the local plan stipulates, but where more affordable housing is required, and it is 50% under the emerging, draft London Plan, that should be delivered.  

Closer inspection raises some other concerns.

There is an ambiguity over the social rented housing; the application and [officer's report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!S%2bIqqCm1W5sBBPLbS6aFWQ%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) refers to social rented housing, yet the [GLA Stage 1 report](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/PAWS/media_id_414643/ruby_triangle_sandgate_street_report.pdf)   refers to same units as 'affordable rent', which can be up to 80% market rent.

The GLA Stage 2 report is not available at the time of going to committee. There is no explanation why this application is going to committee before this report is published, which is usual practice and a fairly major departure from due process.

The affordable housing provider A2Dominion also rings an alarm bell.  They featured in our [successful complaint](http://35percent.org/2016-12-12-ombudsman-slams-southwark-for-no-s106-monitoring/) to the Ombudsman about [tenure switching](http://35percent.org/redefining-social-rent/), where affordable rent was substituted in developments where social rent had been approved, in this case the [Colorama development](http://35percent.org/2016-02-16-the-affordable-housing-mirage/#a2dominion-tenure-switch-example) in Blackfriars. A2Dominium, was also subject to a [planning breach investigation](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/enforcementDetails.do?previousCaseType=Property&keyVal=_STHWR_ECAPR_7108&previousCaseNumber=_STHWR_PROPLPI_116659_1&previousCaseUprn=200003453347&activeTab=summary&previousKeyVal=_STHWR_PROPLPI_116659_1) from Southwark Council for its development at 166-178 Camberwell Rd, which has stood half-finished since 2015.

## Profit vs affordable housing - what's reasonable?
There is an unresolved dispute about the reasonable level of profit to be assumed in the viability assessment for the private housing.  This could have a bearing on the final amount of affordable housing, to be calculated by a late viability review mechanism.  Crudely, the higher the profit the less that is left for affordable housing. The developer wants 20% profit on GDV (Gross Development Value), while the Council's [independent assessors' report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!7xk%2fKitlYCgrfYEbtqBRDA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) argues that this is too high and that 17.5% is reasonable. This is backed up by the Council's own [viability study](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/assets/attach/1937/Old%20Kent%20Road%20viability%20study%202016.pdf) commissioned for the OKR AAP, which assumes a developer profit of 18% (para 4.39).

*Extract from the [independent viability review](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!7xk%2fKitlYCgrfYEbtqBRDA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d)*

In cash terms Southwark's assessor gives £73.8m as a reasonable profit for the private housing.  According to their [own viability assessment](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!oY11bGc7aC6RJOzPXGXlpQ%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d), where the profits are listed as 'miscellaneous fees', the developer's 20% profit target amounts to £92.21m for the private housing, providing an overall profit assumption of £101.36m, when profits for affordable housing and commercial premises are added in.

## Viable or not viable?
A peculiarity of the Southwark assessor's appraisal of the viability assessment is that it concludes _'that the proposed scheme would not be viable with a 35% affordable housing offer..., but that ‘stand back’ analysis (using evidence of local land sales with planning permission to ascertain a price per habitable room) indicates that it would be deliverable'._  This raises the question of how useful the viability assessment can be, if its conclusion can be discarded and an alternative (undisclosed) 'stand back' analysis, with a different conclusion, is depended on instead.

Similarly, the caveat that an undisclosed '_sensitivity analysis applied in this review also shows that relatively small changes in key variables would result in a viable scheme_' illustrates the uncertainties surrounding the viability assessment for this scheme. [^3]
 
## Waste
 Because of the capital's shortage of waste recycling facilities, the Mayor's London Plan stipulates that any waste recycling facilities lost through redevelopment must be reprovided. The [planning committee report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!S%2bIqqCm1W5sBBPLbS6aFWQ%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) explains that Southwark Council has bought land in the vicinity in order to reprovide these facilities, but doesn't say whether this will be at the Council's or the developer's expense.

*Extract from the [planning committee report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!S%2bIqqCm1W5sBBPLbS6aFWQ%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d)

Along with VitalOKR representatives, we will be making representations and asking questions at the Council's [planning committee](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=119&MId=6037&Ver=4), which meets at Southwark Council's offices on Tooley St 6.30pm Tues 9 Oct. 

Amongst our questions we will be asking:

 * Why is this proposal being recommended for approval before the Area Action Plan has been finalised/adopted?
 * why is there no detailed sunlight/daylight assessment for any of the 1,152 new dwellings?
 * Why are the concerns of the Design Review Panel being ignored?
 * Why is a new 'pocket park' being considered a material benefit to this application when the major part of it is outside the planning proposal and ownership boundaries? 
 * How can the scheme be implemented in a reasonable time frame while Industrial businesses on the site have leases extending 10 years and no relocation alternatives? 
 * How is Southwark going to ensure that A2Dominion provide social rent when it has failed to ensure A2Dominion provided social rent in previous schemes?
 * What land has Southwark purchased to enable the relocation of the waste recyling facilities and is the developer reimbursing the purchase costs - who will be funding/providing the replacement facilities?
