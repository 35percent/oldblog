## Ruby Tuesday

The first of the large planning applications for developments in the Old Kent Rd Opportunity Area goes to Southwark's planning committee on Tues 9 Oct.  It is a mixed-use scheme that would include 1165 homes, with 40.5% affordable housing.

It has nonetheless excited much passionate opposition.  The site is a SIL - site of strategic industrial land and the loss will be contrary to the local plan.  The deVelopment itself has 3 towers, one of 48 storeys another of 40 storeys.  The Old Kent People, a coalition of residents, businesses and community groups and Vital OKR, a business group, have objected because of the loss of industrial land.  They also point out that the treshold for affordable housing, which allows applications to pass more easily through the system, is 50% for SIL sites, in the Mayor's draft New London Plan

The planning application is premature and should be refused on the basis that it
cannot be decided until the New Southwark Plan (“the NSP”) and the Old Kent
Road Area Action Plan (“the AAP”) have been formally adopted;
.
The application should be refused because the mix of unit sizes and tenure
proposed does not correspond with Southwark’s housing need, as reported in the
South East London Strategic Housing Market Assessment (“the SHMA”),
Strategic Policy 7 of the Core Strategy or policy H7 of the draft new London Plan;
.
As the site is located in with an Opportunity Area and Strategic Industrial
Location, the threshold approach of 35% affordable housing is not appropriate for
the site. Draft London Plan Policy H6 sets an affordable housing threshold of 50%
for industrial land;
.
The proposals do not accord with current policy relating to tall buildings. The Old
Kent Road is not identified in the Core Strategy as a location where tall buildings
can be built and the design is not of the exemplary standard required.  Review panel
