## Ruby Tuesday
The first of the very large planning applications lining up to take advantage of the proposed Old Kent Rd Opportunity Area goes to Southwark's planning committee on Tues 9 Oct.  It is for a mixed-use scheme that would include 1152 homes, with 40.5% affordable housing, two-thirds of which will be social rented.  A sports hall, gym and new 'pocket park' are also promised. The scheme is being proposed by a [joint venture](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/10733947/charges) between A2Dominion Housing association and newly-formed Avanton Ltd, [chaired by former defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/michael-fallon-takes-on-property-job-with-avanton-nvgttjprt).

Despite the affordable housing offer, the application has nonetheless excited much passionate opposition.  The site is a SIL - site of strategic industrial land and the loss of industrial space will be contrary to the local plan. The proposed development has 3 towers, one of 48 storeys another of 40 storeys.  The Old Kent Road People, a coalition of residents, businesses and community groups and Vital OKR, a business group, have objected because of the loss of industrial land   Thirteen businesses and a church currently occupy the site, with about 130 employees.  Objectors also point out that, while 40% affordable housing appears generous, the treshold for affordable housing is 50% for SIL sites in the Mayor's draft New London Plan.  Local residents along Canal Grove Cottages fear a loss of light, and the detrimental impact on the local environment of a scheme that is nearly four times denser than the local plan allows (27013 habitable rooms per hectare against a maximum 700h hbr per hectare.  The Design Review Panel, which reviews all major developments on Southwark Council's behalf, also serious resevations about the architectural quality, and does not belive that it of the exemplary standard that would justify the greater density).

Ojectors also believe that developers and Southwark are getting ahead of themselves.  The opportunity areea (and area action plan) has not completed its own progress through the planning system and a public inquiry that examines the Opportunity Area's merits and competing development claims on the land is not due to be heard until the new year.

The 35% Camapign is always pleased to see a development that offers more afffordable and social rented housing than the local plan requires.  Closer inspection, though, raises some concerns.  Where more affordable housing is required, 50% under the emerging, draft London Plan, that should be delivered (the late review mechanism Southwark propose is an inadequate substitute).

There is also an ambiguity over the social rented housing; thoughout the application and officer's report it is referred to as such, yet the GLA Stage 1 report refers to same units as 'affordable rent', which can be up to 80% market rent.  The affordable housing provider A2Dominiun also rings an alarm bell.  They featured in our successful complaint to the Ombudsman about tenure swutching, where affordable rent was substituted in developments where social rent had been approved, in this case the Colorama development in Blackfriars,  A2Dominium, was also subject to a planning breach notification from Southwark Council for a development at 166-178 Cmaberwell Rd and the site has stood half-finished since 2015.

Should the scheme get the go-ahead, developer stands to make either £67m or £73m, according to Southwark or £101m, depending upon whichever figure you depend on in the viabilityon which viability apprais


There is an unresolved dispute about the reasonable level of profit to be assumed in the viability assessment. The developer is claiming a profit level of 20% while the Council's [independent assessors' report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!7xk%2fKitlYCgrfYEbtqBRDA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) argues that this is too high and that 17.5% is the reasonable profit margin. This is backed up by the Council's own [viability study](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/assets/attach/1937/Old%20Kent%20Road%20viability%20study%202016.pdf) commissioned for the OKR AAP, which assumes a developer profit margin of 18% (para 4.39).

The difference between 17.5% profit and the 20% claimed is approximately £20m. If the Council were to have held firm, this could have been £20m that the scheme could have contributed towards..


Stage 2 GLA report - why is this going to committee before the GLA has issued its stage 2 report? especially given the concerns raised in the stage 1 report.

No information on whether any of the 1,152 dwellings proposed comply with the BRE's minimum daylight requirements..
