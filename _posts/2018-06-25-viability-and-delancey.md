##Delancey's subsidised profit

Just over a week before the shopping centre planning application goes before Southwark's planning committee [for the third time](http://35percent.org/2018-06-26-delancey-tries-again/) a slew of viability documents were released. Given the size of the main document, the full financial viability assessment [(FVA)](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!7Op6ZeDkjdW7huGG0wKoxg%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) it has not been possible for campaigners to present a complete response, but some interesting facts have come to light nonetheless.
As is usual developer Delancey claims its affordable housing offer is the most it can possible provide and, as is also usual, it falls some way short of what Southwark's planning policy requires.  Delancey has upped the number of social rented units from 33, first to 74 and then to 116, but this is still some way short of the 165 or so needed for policy compliance. Delancey were helped along by a £11.25m grant from the Greater London Authority (GLA), which promptly found its way straight to Delanceys bottom line, increasing its profit by exactly the same amount.  We can see this be comapring two development appraisals of the scheme.  The first, dated xx June 2018, is for a scheme with 116 social rented units, but withour grant funding, which has a profit of £137m.  The second, dated yy June 2018, is for a scheme with 116 social rented units, but with the £11.25m GLA grant, which, by a miracle of development finance, has a profit of £148m.  Delancey have responded to cries of 'subsidise homes, not profit' pretty much confirming that his is what has happened, but referring to the difference in the profit levels as a 'viability gap' and pleading that it 'maintains' the profit, not 'enhances' it.  Most peple will struggle to see the difference and would think the money better spent on te social housing it claims it cannot afford to build. https://twitter.com/ShapingElephant/status/1012006789997580294?s=19the 
Another curiosity is the price of the social rented units.  Delancey will not be building them for nothing and they will be sold to a registered provider of affordable housing or Southwark Council. The unit price given in the development appraisals is £229,864 (total £26.66m for 116 units).  However an earlier development appraisal, dated 20 Feb 2018, for the first revised offer of 74 social rented units gives the unit price as £78,674 (total £5.82m).  Clearly Delancey have more than one way of 'maintaining' profits; together with the GLA grant they will have 'maintained' their profits by a extra £32m of public money, as a result of revising their original affordable housing offer. 

Delancey claims that its affordable housing offer is the maximum it can viably provide, but its [viability assessment](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!eW5y4yYs725p%2bJMli9Cf8g%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) contains several unexplained costs. Firstly there is a £79m unnamed construction cost on the East Site:

Secondly, there are two acquisition costs plus stamp duty amounting to £142m and a further £15m unitemised development cost included in Delancey's viability assessment (which was only made public at the end of last week):

Given that Delancey has owned the shopping centre since 2013 and is developing the land in partnership with the UAL which has owned its site for decades, we are at a loss as to explain what these acquisition costs represent and why they have been included as a cost to the scheme in Delancey's viability assessment.
