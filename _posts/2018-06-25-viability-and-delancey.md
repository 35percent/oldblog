## Viability and Delancey

Just over a week before the shopping centre planning application goes before Southwark's planning committee for the third time (link) a slew of viability documents were released (link). Given the size of the main document, the the full financial viability assessment it has not been poosible for campaigners to present a complete response, but some interesting facts have come to light.
As is usual developer Delancey claims its affordable housing offer is the most it can possible provide and, as is also usual it falls some way short of what Southwark's planning policg requires.  it has upped the number of social rented units from 33, first to 74 and then to 116; this still leavesi tsome way short of the 165 or so needed for polciy compliance.its social rened nu

Delancey claims that its affordable housing offer is the maximum it can viably provide, but its [viability assessment](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!eW5y4yYs725p%2bJMli9Cf8g%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) contains several unexplained costs.

Given that Delancey has owned the shopping centre since 2013 and is developing the land in partnership with the UAL which has owned its site for decades, we are at a loss as to explain what these acquisition costs represent and why they have been included as a cost to the scheme in Delancey's viability assessment.
