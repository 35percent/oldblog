In response to criticism of his administration's failure to secure social rented housing from developers, last week Council leader Peter John [claimed on Twitter](https://twitter.com/peterjohn6/status/910181725187305472) that 40% of new homes delivered in the borough over the last 5 years were social rented:

We are blocked by Councillor John on Twitter, so we couldn't engage in the conversation. 

We can show that the 40% figure is not grounded in facts, not the GLA's facts anyway. Every year the Mayor produces an annual monitoring report showing how many affordable homes are provided in each borough.

The [report for the current year 2016/17](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/amr_13.pdf) shows a net gain of 13 social rented homes over the past three years.

Table 3.7 of the report shows that there were a total of 5,220 net completions over the same period.

Note that the GLA figures are net figures and whilst they don't take into acccount social rented homes lost through Right to Buy, they do take into account the number of social rented homes demolished. Given Southwark's [ongoing pipeline of estate demolitions](http://35percent.org/the-southwark-clearances/) it is no surprise that the net gain in social rented housing is extremely low. 

Three years ago Councillor John announced the 'largest council house building programme in the country' with a commitment to build 11,000 new Council homes over the next 30 years. Councillor John even took the trouble of writing an [open letter](http://35percent.org/img/pj11000councilhomesletter.pdf) reassuring sceptics that the 11,000 new homes would be a net increase:

Earlier this year, the Council [acknowledged](https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/council-admits-will-miss-target-build-1500-new-council-homes-2018/) that it was failing its targets. Quite what the extent of this failure is has now become apparent. 

Meanwhile, demolition of the 2,600 council homes on the Aylesbury estate continues and the 'social rented' homes built as replacements will be [social rent only by name](http://35percent.org/redefining-social-rent/).

## Listening to communities
Earlier this week Council leader Peter John spoke at the Labour party conference in Brighton on 'Listening to communities - the future of social housing post Grenfell'.

Lets hope his model of 'listening to communities' is not adopted by the Labour party - Heygate and Aylesbury etc. 

PJ is much better at listening to developers rather than communities.

This is confirmed in a recent Vice article: https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/43avj3/the-london-lobbyist-with-ties-to-billions-of-pounds-of-gentrification

Lendlease listed amongst Terrapin's clients and PJ had seven meetings with Mr Bingle.
