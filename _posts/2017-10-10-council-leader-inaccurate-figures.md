In response to criticism of his administration's failure to secure social rented housing from developers, last week Council leader Peter John [claimed on Twitter](https://twitter.com/peterjohn6/status/910181725187305472) that 40% of new homes delivered in the borough over the last 5 years were social rented:

We are blocked by Councillor John on Twitter, so we couldn't engage in the conversation. 

We can show that the 40% figure is not grounded in facts, not the GLA's facts anyway. Every year the Mayor produces a monitoring report showing how many affordable homes are provided in each borough.

These show that...


Southwark is knocking down council homes quicker than it can secure new social rented homes from developers.

Earlier this year, the Council acknowledged that it was failing in its programme to build new council homes: https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/council-admits-will-miss-target-build-1500-new-council-homes-2018/.


## Listening to communities
Earlier this week Council leader Peter John spoke at the Labour party conference in Brighton on 'Listening to communities - the future of social housing post Grenfell'.

Lets hope his model of 'listening to communities' is not adopted by the Labour party - Heygate and Aylesbury etc. 

PJ is much better at listening to developers rather than communities.

This is confirmed in a recent Vice article: https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/43avj3/the-london-lobbyist-with-ties-to-billions-of-pounds-of-gentrification

Lendlease listed amongst Terrapin's clients and PJ had seven meetings with Mr Bingle.
