title: Council leader Peter John - the alternative facts

In response to criticism of his administration's failure to secure social rented housing from developers, last week Southwark Council leader Peter John [claimed on Twitter](https://twitter.com/peterjohn6/status/910181725187305472) that 40% of new homes delivered in the borough over the last 5 years were social rented:

We're blocked by Councillor John on Twitter, so we couldn't engage in the conversation or ask Councillor John where he got his 'Facts' from.

However, we can show that Cllr John's 40% figure is not grounded in reality. Every year the London Mayor produces an Annual Monitoring Report, showing how many affordable homes are provided in each borough, along with a breakdown of tenures. The [report for the current year 2016/17](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/amr_13.pdf) shows a net gain of 13 social rented homes over the past three years. This is out of a total 5,220 new homes built in the borough over those three years (Table 3.7). 

That's an average net gain of just 4 social rented homes per year (if they are social rent; we have [shown before](/redefining-social-rent) how Southwark turns a blind eye to developers and housing associations proving affordable rent instead).

The Mayor's figures are net figures and whilst they don't take into acccount social rented homes lost through Right to Buy, they do take into account the number of social rented homes demolished. Given Southwark's [ongoing pipeline of estate demolitions](http://35percent.org/the-southwark-clearances/) it is therefore no surprise that the net gain in social rented housing is in some years a negative figure and overall extremely low. 

## Southwark knocking 'em down faster than it's putting 'em up

Southwark were a bit more candid about their failure earlier in the year when it [acknowledged](https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/council-admits-will-miss-target-build-1500-new-council-homes-2018/) that it had not reached the first-phase target for its 11,000 council house building programme.

When this programme was announced 3 years ago as the 'largest council house building programme in the country' sceptics complained that the plans were nothing but PR spin that would be used to cover up the extent of the growing programme of council estate demolitions.

Councillor John responded with an [open letter](http://35percent.org/img/pj11000councilhomesletter.pdf)guaranteeing that the 11,000 new council homes would be a in addition to the current council housing stock, in other words 'net'.

The net figures in the Mayor's Annual Monitoring Reports show just how far Southwark are fom achieving this.

## Listening to communities
Earlier this week Council leader Peter John spoke at the Labour party conference alongside Labour's shadow Minister for housing John Healey. The title of the talk was _'Listening to communities - the future of social housing post Grenfell'_.

We hope that Councillor John's model of 'listening to communities' is not adopted by the rest of the Labour party. Heygate residents were [denied a ballot](http://heygate.github.io/img/councilrulesoutvote.pdf) and 70% of residents balloted on the Aylesbury estate [voted against demolition](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2001/dec/27/1), on a 73% ballot turnout. If this is listening to communities then it is the Grenfell model of listening to communities and needs to change.

## The Listening Council
Private eye has shown us that Councillor John is much better at listening to developers than he is to communities.

This is further confirmed by a [recent article](https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/43avj3/the-london-lobbyist-with-ties-to-billions-of-pounds-of-gentrification) in Vice magazine, where Councillor John is found to have had no less than seven meetings with London lobbyist Peter Bingle, who works [in the service of Lendlease](https://web.archive.org/web/20170614105632/http://www.terrapincommunications.co.uk/our-clients/).

Councillor John is not the only Southwark Councillor good at listening to developers; our [growing dossier](http://35percent.org/revolving-doors) shows a growing number of Southwark Labour members and officials with links to the development industry. These are surely not Labour values that deserve promoting..
