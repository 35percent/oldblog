We have already [shown how Delancey betrayed](http://35percent.org/tribeca-square/#affordable-retail-units-sold-to-sainsburys) its planning obligation requirements to provide affordable retail on its neighbouring [__Elephant One__](/tribeca-square) scheme.

Now it appears that further breaches of planning consent are afoot.

The [Planning Committee report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!KVVznBUP22aHb8QmfxcSTA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) for __Elephant One__ says that community facilities would be provided in the form of a gym:

Sure enough the requirement was written in to the [section 106 agreement](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!yzWhLCC2jRbP5NWsu4IkfQ%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d):

Instead it looks as if they have built a gym.


Here's another extract from the section 106 showing the creche next to the cinema:

Err, where is the cinema?...

Conclusion: anything goes - developers behaving badly. Southwark doesn't care - Ombudsman complaint - still no audit.. bla bla..
