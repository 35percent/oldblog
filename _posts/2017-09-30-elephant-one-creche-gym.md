Planning gain - explain concept, i.e. to ensure that developments contribute something to the community around them. s106 requirements are based on local need. Given the shortfall in local creche facilities (ref) bla bla..

[Planning Committee report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!KVVznBUP22aHb8QmfxcSTA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) says that community facilities will be provided in the form of a gym:

Sure enough the requirement was written in to the [section 106 agreement](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!yzWhLCC2jRbP5NWsu4IkfQ%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d):

Instead they have built a gym.


Here's another extract from the section 106 showing the creche next to the cinema:

Err, where is the cinema?...

Conclusion: anything goes - developers behaving badly. Southwark doesn't care - Ombudsman complaint - still no audit.. bla bla..
