Notting Hill Housing started demolition around the Aylesbury leaseholders nailhouses.

Water supply cut off - no hot water for 6 days, showering at friends and relatives/swimming baths.

This follows gas leak where one resident was hospitalised.

Notting Hill should stop demolition while the CPO case is being heard. 

It should be getting on with its other developments at Manor Place Depot and Wood Dene estate first. Both these sites have been empty for many years. It makes no sense in a housing crisis for Notting Hill to be demolishing council homes on the Aylsebury when it is sitting on xxumpteen acres of derelict land where it hasn't built a single home yet.

The resident who died - Stefan Terrence Crossfield, 28 Arklow SE17 2BJ. TGL 2544382

Follows Mr Hilmi.
