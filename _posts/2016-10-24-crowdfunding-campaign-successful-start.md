## Crowdfunding success
Our [crowdfunding 
campaign](https://www.gofundme.com/aylesbury-the-right-to-a-community-2uefgf2s) 
to help fight Southwark's appeal of the Aylesbury CPO decision has gotten off 
to a successful start. We have raised over £2000 in the first week alone. This 
has enabled the leaseholders' barrister to start work on the case and submit 
preliminary responses to the Council's [letter before 
claim](http://35percent.org/img/20161007_Secretary_of_State_Aylesbury_CPO.pdf).

On Monday, the Secretary of State issued his [detailed 
response](/img/SoSresponsetoLbC.pdf)  to Southwark's 'letter before claim'.It 
says he considers Southwark's grounds of appeal 'unarguable' and has vowed to 
'robustly defend' its CPO decision and 'seek his costs of doing so'.

Meanwhile, Southwark continues to justify its appeal by claiming that the CPO 
decision is preventing it from continuing with the regeneration of the estate 
which will deliver at least 1,260 new 'affordable' homes. 

Southwark has made a big deal of the fact that the Aylesbury estate is being 
redeveloped by a Notting Hill Housing Trust, a 'non-profit' housing 
association.  It has kept silent about the fact that Notting Hill's _'developer 
partner'_ for the scheme is the UK's largest private developer, Barratt Homes 
and that Barratt will be both building and selling all of the redeveloped 
estate's 1773 private market homes.

Barratt was in the news last week, when its top London executive was 
[arrested](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/19/barratt-executive-arrested-internal-inquiry-alastair-baird) 
on suspicion of bribery following an investigation into the awarding of 
contracts.

AND
_Alastair Baird, Regional Managing Director of Barratt London, said: "We are delighted to be working on the regeneration at Canada Water and are progressing quickly with the construction of high quality new homes for Rotherhithe. In the last two years, we have delivered 232 new homes and work is progressing well on the next phases of the development, with almost 700 more homes due for completion by summer 2013."_ from http://www.southwark.gov.uk/news/article/146/new_iconic_southwark_building_emerges

Notting Hill Housing hasn't been subject to any such criminal investigation, 
but we have shown how its conduct has been undoubtedly questionable. We saw how they 
[substituted](http://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/council-takes-no-legal-action-over-44-missing-social-housing-units/) 
affordable rent for social rent at the [Bermondsey Spa 
regeneration](http://35percent.org/bermondsey-spa-regeneration/) and how [GLA 
data](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/gla-affordable-housing-programme-outturn/resource/0c87e5dc-f1e9-4edf-b246-bef6b40a9ba3) 
shows it having delivered replacement 'social' housing on the Elmington estate 
at affordable rents of up to 65% market rent.  

## Not just Southwark
What we haven't mentioned before is that this 'tenure switch' practice appears to 
extend to beyond Southwark and it appears that Lambeth is having the wool 
pulled over its eyes by Notting Hill too.

In 2013, Lambeth Council [sold](/img/LRclaremontgarages.pdf) land on its 
Claremont East estate in Brixton Hill to Notting Hill Housing for the knock 
down price of £1.5m, on the basis that it would provide 100% social rented 
housing.

minutes](https://moderngov.lambeth.gov.uk/mgAi.aspx?ID=13743)*

Lambeth's planning committee had previously 
[resolved](https://moderngov.lambeth.gov.uk/mgAi.aspx?ID=13743) to grant 
Notting Hill consent to build on the garages site, on the basis that 70% of the 
affordable housing built would be social rented.
![](/img/claremontplanningcommittee.png)
*Extract from the [planning committee 
report](https://moderngov.lambeth.gov.uk/mgAi.aspx?ID=13743)* 

However, [GLA 
data](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/gla-affordable-housing-programme-outturn/resource/0c87e5dc-f1e9-4edf-b246-bef6b40a9ba3) 
shows that these have been provided instead as affordable rent (charging up to 68% 
market rent).

Likewise, Lambeth's [Planning Committee 
report](https://moderngov.lambeth.gov.uk/mgConvert2PDF.aspx?ID=16725) for 
Notting Hill's 'Fabrik' development on Coldharbour lane shows it was given 
consent for 43 social rented homes. We understand from the CORE lettings data 
system that a number of these are now being let at affordable rent. 

Notting Hill is open about its [pipeline of new 
homes](http://www.cih.org/resources/PDF/Event%20pdfs/Presentations/Developing%20affordable%20housing/Andy%20Belton.pdf) 
providing only for affordable rent rather than social rent.

We are under no doubt what type of 'social' housing Notting Hill is planning to 
provide on the redeveloped [Wood 
Dene](http://35percent.org/wood-dene-estate-regeneration/) and Aylesbury 
estates.

## Key drivers
Notting Hill is one of the key drivers behind the 
[g15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G15_%28housing_associations%29) – who 
represent London’s largest housing associations. Last week it [launched a 
report](https://www.nhhg.org.uk/news/news/all/meeting-the-challenges-of-urban-renewal/) 
which documents 35 of estate regeneration projects across London. It highlights 
the importance of estate regeneration in solving the capital’s housing crisis 
and identifies what is required to deliver more. We note that the g15 report 
was also authored with the help of Southwark's Director of Housing & 
Modernisation Gerri Scott[^1]. 

The report repeats all of the usual right wing arguments against council 
estates: create mixed communities; replace poor quality housing; address social 
deprivation etc, etc.

*Extract from the G15 estate regeneration report*

The report goes on to make 5 recommendations to policy makers for furthering estate renewal programmes. One of these asks for fewer restrictions over rent levels:

This echoes Notting Hill CEO Kate Davies' call for less rent control in the [policy paper](http://www.centreforsocialjustice.org.uk/UserStorage/pdf/Pdf%20reports/HousingPoverty.pdf) she co-authored with Iain Duncan-Smith for the CSJ think tank.

## St James Place
St James Place estate is a good example of what happens when Notting Hill takes over an estate from the local authority and is free to sent rent levels without restrictions. Rent hikes of xx have resulted in a spate of evictions. http://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/housing-association-slammed-nightmare-scenario-eviction-threat-bermondseys-st-james-estate/

CHECK OUT THESE, maybe we can figure out the rent increase and also extract weekly rents from this:
