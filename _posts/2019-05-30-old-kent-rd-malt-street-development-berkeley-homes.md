title: Old Kent Rd Malt Street development (Berkeley Homes)
---
Southwark's planning committee is set to approve yet another major Old Kent Rd development on Monday. It will be the fourth after [Ruby Triangle], Cantium Retail park and [Southernwood Retail Park]. Southernwood was unanimously approved by Southwark's planning committee just last week after despite objections and serious concerns from TfL. On the latter the committee was reassured by a letter sent by TfL the very afternoon of the meeting. 

Berkeley Homes has applied to build xxx homes on a small parcel of land behind B&Q.

Malt Street is the fourth (of five?) major schemes that will make up the ...

## Taking the 'social' out of social rent
Nowhere in any of the circa 230 supporting documents in Berkeley's planning application does the term 'social rent' appear.

All documents referring to tenure use the term 'rent' or 'affordable rent'.

Even the Mayor's [planning report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!haTo0z2rc9BKNsdNgCZODw%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) avoids using the term 'social rent' and instead describes the proposed tenure as 'low-cost rent'. (para 33)

Berkeley's [viability assessment](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!R3Si0Rp49ADxAyylzQ24ww%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) uses the term 'affordable rented':

The [S106 draft heads of terms document](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!CQmOQKOASqZFZSaVyAtPJA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) says this:

The planning committee report uses the term 'social rent' but as we have [seen before](http://35percent.org/redefining-social-rent) this does not provide a guarantee that social rent will be delivered.

Still waiting for the [promised audit](https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/council-will-clamp-housing-providers-flunk-affordable-housing-promises/) after the [damning ombudsman investigation](http://35percent.org/2016-12-12-ombudsman-slams-southwark-for-no-s106-monitoring/) which found that Southwark didn't bother to monitor or enforce the tenure requirements of s106 affordable housing agreements.

## Viability assessment - cooking the books
As with last week's [Southernwood scheme] Berkeley has submitted a viability assessment (compiled by Savills) saying that delivering 35% affordable housing is unviable (unprofitable enough). Berkeley assumes an estimated sales value of its completed homes of £7xx per square foot on average. 

In arriving at this figure Savills has used the latest completed phase of Elephant Park (aka Heygate estate) as a sales comparable. This phase sold on average for £12xx per square foot. We remember Lendlease's viability assessment saying that they would sell for half this amount..

## Late stage review
Para 32 of the [Mayor's planning report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!haTo0z2rc9BKNsdNgCZODw%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) says:

"The application does not therefore follow the Fast Track Route with 35% affordable housing (as the threshold level would be 50% in this instance), and it must therefore be considered under the viability tested route.""The application does not therefore follow the Fast Track Route with 35% affordable housing (as the threshold level would be 50% in this instance), and it must therefore be considered under the viability tested route."Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing on behalf of the 35% Campaign to object to the recommended approval of planning application ref: 17/AP/2773.

The planning committee report for this application refers to the 40% affordable housing offer as exceeding the policy compliant level, stated as 35% (para 167). However, para 22 of the report also notes that the site is 'designated Strategic Industrial Land (SIL), in the London Plan'; as such, the draft New London Plan requires a higher, 50% level of affordable housing under Policy H6, Para B(3).

The planning committee report gives weight to the draft New London Plan and other emerging policy to justify the release of industrial land for residential and other development (para 145), in the first instance; therefore equal weight should be given to the 50% affordable housing requirement for housing built on such land and 50% affordable housing required. 

Without 50% affordable housing the application fails to qualify for the draft London Plan's Fast Track route under the threshold approach to viability testing. Policy H6 is clear that applications that do not meet the 50% SIL threshold are subject to the viability tested route, which involves a Late Stage Viability review (Para E 2(b)). This is confirmed in the GLA Stage 1 report for the scheme (para 32), which states;

'However, as set out above the application site is in predominantly industrial use and the proposals would not re-provide the industrial capacity of the site on a 65% plot ratio. The application does not therefore follow the Fast Track Route with 35% affordable housing (as the threshold level would be 50% in this instance), and it must therefore be considered under the viability tested route'.

A late stage review should therefore be required if 50% affordable housing is not to be delivered.

For these reasons and in the light of the Stage 1 report, we believe that the planning committee report is wrong when it states that the affordable housing offer 'exceeds the 35% GLA threshold level' and 're-provides the existing commercial floorspace' and that therefore there need be no late stage review (para 171). (NB Nothing in Policy H6 says that the 50% threshold for SIL locations can be avoided if existing commercial floorspace is re-provided).

As the application is a large phased development a mid-term review should also be required, according to Policy H6, Para E 2(c).

Yours sincerely
