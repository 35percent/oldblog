title: Old Kent Rd Malt Street development (Berkeley Homes)
---
Southwark's planning committee is to consider yet another major Old Kent Rd development on Monday, the fourth so far, after [Ruby Triangle], Cantium Retail park and [Southernwood Retail Park]. Southernwood was unanimously approved by Southwark's planning committee just last week, despite objections, including doubts about whether it that it will deliver the maximum reaonable amount of affordable housing. Serious concerns raised about the impact of the scheme on the proposed Bakerloo Line Extension (BLE), were allayed by a last minute letter to the Council from Transport for London (TfL).

Berkeley Homes proposes a mixed use development, including 1,300 homes and 7,000 sqm of commercial space, on a 1.9 hectares of land behind B&Q. It is a 'hybrid'' application of two parts, a detailed application for 420 homes, and an outline application for 880 more.  The total development comprises 11 blocks, including thirty-nine and 444 storey towers.

## Taking the 'social' out of social rent?

As stated in the [planning committee report], Berkeley propose 35% affordable housing, of which 25% would be social rent, 10% intermediate, with an additional 5% intermediate, supplied with the help of grant funding.  However, throughout Berkeley's planning application the term 'social rent' does not appear, with the supporting documents, such as the [viability assessment](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!R3Si0Rp49ADxAyylzQ24ww%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) uses the term 'affordable rented':referring instead to 'rent' or 'affordable rent'.

Even the Mayor's Stage 1 [planning report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!haTo0z2rc9BKNsdNgCZODw%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) avoids using the term 'social rent' and instead describes the proposed tenure as 'low-cost rent'. (para 33)  This is yet another affordable housing label, newly introduced by the Mayors draft New London Plan, where it is defined to include London Affordable Rent, as well as social rent.  The London Tenants Federation has given evidence to the Mayor that there is a 45% difference between LAR and council rent, while GLA has conceded in the Plan's public examination that there is a 14% difference in new build LAR/social rent. 


The [S106 draft heads of terms document](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!CQmOQKOASqZFZSaVyAtPJA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) says that the exact tenure of the affordable housing will not be decided until after the application is approved:

We have [seen before](http://35percent.org/redefining-social-rent) promises of social rent do no not necessarily guarantee that social rent will be delivered and we are still waiting for the [promised audit](https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/council-will-clamp-housing-providers-flunk-affordable-housing-promises/) of affordable and social rented housing after a [damning ombudsman investigation](http://35percent.org/2016-12-12-ombudsman-slams-southwark-for-no-s106-monitoring/), which found that Southwark had not monitored or enforced the tenure requirements of all its s106 affordable housing agreements.

## Viability assessment flaw

Just like Ruby Triangle, Cantium Retail Park and Southernwood Retail Park, the developers claims that the Malt scheme is technically unviable, with 35% affordable housing.  Berkeley [viability assessment](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!R3Si0Rp49ADxAyylzQ24ww%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) says that Malt St will produce a 'substandard return. 

Southwark's consultant's agree with this analysis, albeit they think the scheme slightly less unviable than Berkeley does.  In any event, Berkeley offer 40% affordable housing on the understanding that viability will be improved by better transport links (ie the Bakerloo Line Exetension) and the ongoing regeneraation of the area.  There is an important proviso, however - that there will be no alte stage review.  This pre-empts any possibility that the amount of affordable housing will be raised to 50%, as reqiured by the draft London Plan, whci will be fully in force by the time Malt St is completed.

As with all viability assessments they are based on current day values. Berkeley commissioned Savills to provide a current day estimate of what sales values would be if the development were completed today.

assumes an estimated sales value of its completed homes of £776 per square foot on average. 

![](http://35percent.org/img/maltst776.png)

In arriving at this figure Savills uses comparable sales from developments in the surrounding area. One of these is Elephant Park (aka. Heygate estate) where it says that sales are currently achieving £1,247/sqft

![](http://35percent.org/img/eparksales.png)

We remember the [Savill's report] submitted as part of [Lendlease's viability assessment](http://35percent.org/collated-viability-assessments/#heygate-viability-assessment) saying that they would sell for half this amount..

![](http://35percent.org/img/heygate600psf.png)

This is a major flaw in viability testing methodology - i.e. the fact that the assessment is based on current values. It is supposed to be compensated for by what is called 'scenario testing' whereby different scenarios are run but these are often inadequate. In the Heygate case there was a scenario run with a 5% increase in sales values. In the event there was a 100% increase in sales values.

Berkeley's viability assessment hasn't done any scenario testing. The Council's independent review do some scenario testing but on ly with a 15% increase in sales values.

For major schemes like these that are likely to take over a decade to complete and where values are likely to be affected by major variables such as the Bakerloo line extension better more comprehensive scenario testing should have been undertaken. 

In the absence of this the very least the Council should do is secure a late stage review mechanism, which ensures that any excess rise in values is clawed back in the form of extra affordable housing.

## Late stage review
Para 32 of the [Mayor's planning report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!haTo0z2rc9BKNsdNgCZODw%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) says:

"The application does not therefore follow the Fast Track Route with 35% affordable housing (as the threshold level would be 50% in this instance), and it must therefore be considered under the viability tested route.""The application does not therefore follow the Fast Track Route with 35% affordable housing (as the threshold level would be 50% in this instance), and it must therefore be considered under the viability tested route."Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing on behalf of the 35% Campaign to object to the recommended approval of planning application ref: 17/AP/2773.

The planning committee report for this application refers to the 40% affordable housing offer as exceeding the policy compliant level, stated as 35% (para 167). However, para 22 of the report also notes that the site is 'designated Strategic Industrial Land (SIL), in the London Plan'; as such, the draft New London Plan requires a higher, 50% level of affordable housing under Policy H6, Para B(3).

The planning committee report gives weight to the draft New London Plan and other emerging policy to justify the release of industrial land for residential and other development (para 145), in the first instance; therefore equal weight should be given to the 50% affordable housing requirement for housing built on such land and 50% affordable housing required. 

Without 50% affordable housing the application fails to qualify for the draft London Plan's Fast Track route under the threshold approach to viability testing. Policy H6 is clear that applications that do not meet the 50% SIL threshold are subject to the viability tested route, which involves a Late Stage Viability review (Para E 2(b)). This is confirmed in the GLA Stage 1 report for the scheme (para 32), which states;

'However, as set out above the application site is in predominantly industrial use and the proposals would not re-provide the industrial capacity of the site on a 65% plot ratio. The application does not therefore follow the Fast Track Route with 35% affordable housing (as the threshold level would be 50% in this instance), and it must therefore be considered under the viability tested route'.

A late stage review should therefore be required if 50% affordable housing is not to be delivered.

For these reasons and in the light of the Stage 1 report, we believe that the planning committee report is wrong when it states that the affordable housing offer 'exceeds the 35% GLA threshold level' and 're-provides the existing commercial floorspace' and that therefore there need be no late stage review (para 171). (NB Nothing in Policy H6 says that the 50% threshold for SIL locations can be avoided if existing commercial floorspace is re-provided).

As the application is a large phased development a mid-term review should also be required, according to Policy H6, Para E 2(c).

Yours sincerely
