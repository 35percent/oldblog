Malt Street is the fourth (of five?) major schemes that will make up the ...

## Taking the 'social' out of social rent
Nowhere in any of the circa 230 supporting documents in Berkeley's planning application does the term 'social rent' appear.

All documents referring to tenure use the term 'rent' or 'affordable rent'.

Even the Mayor's [planning report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!haTo0z2rc9BKNsdNgCZODw%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) avoids using the term 'social rent' and instead describes the proposed tenure as 'low-cost rent'. (para 33)

Berkeley's [viability assessment](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!R3Si0Rp49ADxAyylzQ24ww%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) uses the term 'affordable rented':

The [S106 draft heads of terms document](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!CQmOQKOASqZFZSaVyAtPJA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) says this:

The planning committee report uses the term 'social rent' but as we have [seen before](http://35percent.org/redefining-social-rent) this does not provide a guarantee that social rent will be delivered.

Still waiting for the [promised audit](https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/council-will-clamp-housing-providers-flunk-affordable-housing-promises/) after the [damning ombudsman investigation](http://35percent.org/2016-12-12-ombudsman-slams-southwark-for-no-s106-monitoring/) which found that Southwark didn't bother to monitor or enforce the tenure requirements of s106 affordable housing agreements.

## Viability assessment - cooking the books
As with last week's [Southernwood scheme] Berkeley has submitted a viability assessment (compiled by Savills) saying that delivering 35% affordable housing is unviable (unprofitable enough). Berkeley assumes an estimated sales value of its completed homes of £7xx per square foot on average. 

In arriving at this figure Savills has used the latest completed phase of Elephant Park (aka Heygate estate) as a sales comparable. This phase sold on average for £12xx per square foot. We remember Lendlease's viability assessment saying that they would sell for half this amount..

## Late stage review
Para 32 of the [Mayor's planning report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!haTo0z2rc9BKNsdNgCZODw%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) says:

"The application does not therefore follow the Fast Track Route with 35% affordable housing (as the threshold level would be 50% in this instance), and it must therefore be considered under the viability tested route."
