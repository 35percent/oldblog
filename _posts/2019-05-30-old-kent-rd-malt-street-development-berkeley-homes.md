## 35% but what tenure?
All planning application docs submitted by applicant Berkeley homes refer to affordable rent rather than social rent (list).

The [S106 draft heads of terms document](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!CQmOQKOASqZFZSaVyAtPJA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) says this:

The planning committee report uses the term 'social rent' but as we have [seen before](http://35percent.org/redefining-social-rent) this does not provide a guarantee that social rent will be delivered.

Still waiting for the [promised audit](https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/council-will-clamp-housing-providers-flunk-affordable-housing-promises/) after the [damning ombudsman investigation](http://35percent.org/2016-12-12-ombudsman-slams-southwark-for-no-s106-monitoring/) which found that Southwark didn't bother to monitor or enforce the tenure requirements of s106 affordable housing agreements.

## Viability assessment - cooking the books
As with last week's [Southernwood scheme] Berkeley has submitted a viability assessment (compiled by Savills) saying that delivering 35% affordable housing is unviable (unprofitable enough). Berkeley assumes an estimated sales value of its completed homes of £7xx per square foot on average. 

In arriving at this figure Savills has used the latest completed phase of Elephant Park (aka Heygate estate) as a sales comparable. This phase sold on average for £12xx per square foot.
