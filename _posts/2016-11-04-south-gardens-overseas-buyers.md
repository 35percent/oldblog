Guardian columnist, Labour hack and [gentrification 
apologist](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/oct/24/lets-get-our-gentrification-story-straight) 
Dave Hill, has written an 
[article](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/nov/01/london-housing-sadiq-khan-research-brief-recognises-need-for-overseas-investors) 
claiming that 'foreign buyers have been made an easy scapegoat' for the high 
cost of housing the capital.

The article refers to research being commissioned by City Hall, which is 
attempting to address not only  _'concerns about the role that overseas money 
plays in London’s property market'_, but also _"the positive role that overseas 
buyers play in enabling developments to go ahead."_
 
Dave Hill dismisses the 'populist narrative' around overseas buyers and argues 
that _"a considerable amount of London’s new “affordable” homes aimed at people 
on low and middle incomes are built as a condition of permission being granted 
for large, foreigner-financed housing schemes to go ahead. "_

Last week, the Evening Standard ran a [big splash](/img/standard26102016.pdf) 
echoing a similar trumpeting of the 'affordable' housing these schemes provide.  
It claimed that with 2-beds in [Elephant Park](http://elephantpark.co.uk) 
selling for just shy of £1m, there was plenty of _'sympathy for the Heygate 
residents who put up such a fight to stop the redevelopment'_, but argued that 
locals can nevertheless still pick up an 'affordable' shared ownership flat for 
just £111,250 (for a 25% share of a 1-bed).

What the Evening Standard article doesn't mention is that of the 360 new homes 
in ['South 
Gardens'](http://www.elephantpark.co.uk/elephant-park/explore-the-development/south-garden) 
(the next phase under development), only 25 are available for shared ownership 
and only 7 units were still available at the time it went to print[^1]. The 
small print in the [price 
list](https://lqpricedin.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Elephant-park-1-bed-October16.pdf) 
also shows that a minimum deposit of £30k is required, as is a minimum income 
of £42,918. 

## South (East Asia) Gardens
The vast majority of the remaining units in the next phase of the Heygate 
redevelopment are units for private sale. 

This is plot H06(D,E & F) of South Gardens, otherwise known as 'South Garden 
Point'. There are 179 apartments here - all for private sale. Most have been 
sold. We don't know to who because Lendlease and the Council [won't tell us].  
But we do know that 46 have been sold by Colliers in Hong Kong and Singapore, 
because Colliers' recommended solicitors 'Riseamsharples' has a policy of 
registering purchases with the Land Registry, even though such registration is 
not required or normally effected until the building is completed.

Colliers International was 
[appointed](http://www.costar.co.uk/en/assets/news/2013/April/Lend-Lease-picks-Colliers-to-drive-Elephant-overseas-housing-sales/) 
by Lendlease to market its homes in Singapore and Hong Kong. __Chestertons__ are Lendlease's [appointed agents in Dubai](http://www.tradearabia.com/news/CONS_281117.html), but their solicitors don't register the sales until completion.

Colliers launched sales at South Gardens during [an event on 11th April 
2014](http://www.propertyguru.com.sg/property-management-news/2014/4/37646/elephant-park-sales-in-singapore) in Singapore. Within a month 46 apartments at 'South Garden Point' were 
registered with the Land registry.
