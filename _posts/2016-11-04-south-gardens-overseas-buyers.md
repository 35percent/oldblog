Guardian columnist, Labour hack and [gentrification 
advocate](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/oct/24/lets-get-our-gentrification-story-straight) 
Dave Hill, has written an 
[article](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/nov/01/london-housing-sadiq-khan-research-brief-recognises-need-for-overseas-investors) 
claiming that foreign buyers have been wrongly scapegoated for the high cost of 
housing the capital.

The article refers to research being commissioned by City Hall, which is 
attempting to address not only  _'concerns about the role that overseas money 
plays in London’s property market'_, but also _"the positive role that overseas 
buyers play in enabling developments to go ahead."_
 
Hill dismisses the 'populist narrative' around overseas buyers and argues that 
_"a considerable amount of London’s new “affordable” homes aimed at people on 
low and middle incomes are built as a condition of permission being granted for 
large, foreigner-financed housing schemes to go ahead. "_

Last week, the Evening Standard ran a [big splash](/img/standard26102016.pdf) 
about a large, 'foreigner-financed housing scheme' - the redeveloped Heygate.  
It claimed that while 2-beds in [Elephant Park](http://elephantpark.co.uk) were 
selling for £1m, there was plenty of _'sympathy for the Heygate residents who 
put up such a fight to stop the redevelopment'_, but argued that locals can 
nevertheless still pick up an 'affordable' shared ownership flat for just 
£111,250 (for a 25% share of a 1-bed).

What the Standard article doesn't mention is that of the 360 new homes in 
['South 
Gardens'](http://www.elephantpark.co.uk/elephant-park/explore-the-development/south-garden) 
(the next phase under development), only 25 are available for shared ownership 
and only 7 units were still available at the time it went to print[^1]. The 
small print in the [price 
list](https://lqpricedin.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Elephant-park-1-bed-October16.pdf) 
also shows that a minimum deposit of £30k is required, as is a minimum income 
of £42,918. 

## South (East Asia) Gardens
This is plot H06(D,E & F) of South Gardens, otherwise known as 'South Garden 
Point'. There are two blocks with 179 apartments here - all for private sale.

The South Gardens launch next week is really just there to mop up what's left from the Singapore sales which started with a launch [on 11th April 2014](http://www.propertyguru.com.sg/property-management-news/2014/4/37646/elephant-park-sales-in-singapore). We don't know how many were sold to overseas buyers because Lendlease and the Council [won't 
say](https://youtu.be/WZRV4KMxuEk). What we do know is that 46 of the 179 
apartments have been sold by international real estate firm __Colliers 
International__ in Hong Kong and Singapore. We know this because Colliers' 
[sales brochure](/img/South-Gardens-Fact-Sheet-CIHK.pdf) lists its recommended 
solicitors as ['Riseam 
Sharples'](http://www.riseamsharples.com/legal-services/overseas-property-exhibitions) 
and 46 buyers are listed in the [Land Registry 
deeds](/img/LRegisterSouthGardens.pdf) at Riseam Sharples HQ (2 Tower St, WC2H 
9NP):

[__Riseam 
Sharples__](http://www.riseamsharples.com/legal-services/overseas-property-exhibitions) 
has a policy of registering clients' purchases with the Land Registry, even 
though such registration is not required or normally effected until the 
development is completed.

## Not sure if this next bit is necessary - cut it
Colliers International was 
[appointed](http://www.costar.co.uk/en/assets/news/2013/April/Lend-Lease-picks-Colliers-to-drive-Elephant-overseas-housing-sales/) 
by Lendlease to market its homes only in Singapore and Hong Kong.Colliers 
launched sales at South Gardens during [an event on 11th April 
2014](http://www.propertyguru.com.sg/property-management-news/2014/4/37646/elephant-park-sales-in-singapore) 
in Singapore. Within a month 46 apartments at 'South Garden Point' were 
[registered with the Land registry](/img/LRegisterSouthGardens.pdf).

The UK launch for South Gardens [begins next week](/img/southgardensuklaunch.jpg) with prices starting at £550k. Hurry now - there are only 28 apartments left!

## Panama connections - Total Gain International
We took a closer look at the [Land Registry 
deeds](/img/LRegisterSouthGardens.pdf) to try and find out a bit more a bout 
the 46 buyers who bought through Colliers. A simple google search of the names 
of the buyers in the deeds comes up with the following results. We can't say 
for sure if these are the actual buyers or whether they share the same name.

One of the apartments is registered to a Hong Kong-based asset management company, appropriately called ['Total Gain International Limited'](https://www.hkgbusiness.com/en/company/Total-Gain-International-Limited). Some of the other buyers are listed as:

## Assets not homes
It's clear to see that these are being bought as assets not homes. That's not to say that they won't be lived in, either for a few weeks in the year as a holiday retreat, to [rent out on AirBnB](https://twitter.com/SouthwarkNotes/status/793959246907981824), or to rent out to local people - albeit ones that can afford to pay upwards of £430 per week (for a 1 bed).

This is what Lendlease estimates as the rental income for the cheapest of the remaining flats at South Garden Point (£22,360 per annum). We made enquiries to Lendlease's (domestic) sales team, who sent us the following [price list](/img/Availability_1_bedrooms_WC_South_Gardens.pdf):

## Private Property - cut it, UNNECESSARY
While taking the above photograph of South Gardens we were approached by a Lendlease and told not to take photographs because we were on private property..

## How Laundered money shapes London's property market
_“We think it very likely that the influx of corrupt money into the housing market has pushed up prices,”_ said Rachel Davies, senior advocacy manager at Transparency International. Donald Toon, head of the National Crime Agency, has gone further, saying last year that _“the London property market has been skewed by laundered money. Prices are being artificially driven up by overseas criminals who want to sequester their assets here in the UK”_.

Conclusion: How can an influx of corrupt money into London's property market, artificially driving up prices be a good thing?
