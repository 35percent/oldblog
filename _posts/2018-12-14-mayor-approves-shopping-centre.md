## A week of mixed fortunes for developer

Last Monday shopping centre owner and developer Delancey seemed to have finally secured approval of the redevelopment of the Elephant shoping centre, when Mayor Sadiq Khan [declined to intervene](https://www.docdroid.net/njfeOJz/3654.pdf#page=23) in the decision.  In doing so he followed Southwark Council in defying written objections from seven local ward & constituency level Labour parties [^ 1], two London Assembly members and over a thousand formal objections submitted by local people against [Delancey's disastrous redevelopment of the Elephant & Castle shopping centre](http://35percent.org/shopping-centre).

Come Tuesday, though, Delancey failed to secure planning approval for a vital condition of the shopping centre scheme.  [After a vibrant demonstration](https://twitter.com/uptheelephant_?lang=en&lang=en)outside Southwark's HQ in Tooley Stincluding impassioned speeches from the Latin American community, , planning sub-committee B deferred a decision on Castle Square, the temporary relocation facility for displaced traders.  Delancey [must get this approval](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/mgAi.aspx?ID=49413), before it can go any further with the shopping centre redevelopment.

To make matters worse for Delancey it now looks certain that they will miss the [18 December deadline](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/mgAi.aspx?ID=49413) for concluding the legal S106 agreement that sets the seal on the planning approval. This missed deadline [puts the power to refuse](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/mgAi.aspx?ID=49413)the application into the hands of the Director of Planning.

He has every reason to do this, judging by what was [heard pn Tues evening](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1nAJEywMqObJL).   acknowledged that Castle Square would not be suitable for every kind of trader, but that it was just one of the relocation options. Traders point out, though, that it is the only purpose-built option and after all are taken into account there is still a shortfall in floorspace (link Latin objection).

Close questioning from sub-committee members revealed other shortcomings, including an obvious one, that should larger traders take units in a yet to be settled flexixble design, the Square would accommodate a lot fewer traders overall.

[Distriandina](https://www.thecolombian.co.uk/), home to the Colombian, the 'Heart of Latin London', currently occupies Arch 6.  This is also due for eventual demolition, testified that Castle Square was not a feasible alternative for them. 

Delancey have also dragged their feet setting up the Trader Panel, which has meant that traders have had little influence over the design of Castle Square, prompting several practical objections, such as lack of window space to display goods.  The Traders Panel has also not been able to address fundamental issues, like leases that provide some certainty beyond the life time of Castle Square and the rents to be paid.  This proved to be the biggest problem for sub-committee members.  Delancey claimed that the rents to be paid would be on a par with what is being at the moment by shopping centre

Hammering the final nail in the coffin of the Elephant's long-standing, low-income community, the Mayor issued a [report](https://docdro.id/njfeOJz) on Monday which..

Mayor Khan approves dire E&C scheme

Hopes that the Mayor would have the courage to reject a scheme that enjoys negliglble local support were sorely disappointed by his refusal to intervene.  It transpires that the decision was passed on to deputy mayor for planning Jules Pipe, when the Mayor cited a conflict of interest, being chair of TfL, who stand to gain from the  actually in the Mayors name and under powers develoved to him
TfL trumps locals

We need a better entrance to the Northern Line, but the needs of traders and local people have been sacrificed to secure it.

Thsi is the last chance for a refusal and it should be taken. All the big beasts - the Mayor, GLA, TfL, UAL, Southwark -  have been focussed on what they can get out of the development, in the shape of new tube stations and university campuses, and what are grandly known as 'strategic issues', at the expense of local traders and real affordable housing.  They all supported the scheme with little reservation when it first came forward and it took the local community to step forward to wrest a few small, but important concessions, from Delancey, through outright opposition.  The scheme though largely remains as it was, though.  

Come the 19 December,Southwark can redeem itself by finally putting this

Delancey's scheme is providing only 116.
