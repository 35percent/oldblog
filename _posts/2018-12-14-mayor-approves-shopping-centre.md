## A week of mixed fortunes for developer

Last Monday shopping centre owner and developer Delancey seemed to have finally secured approval of the redevelopment of the Elephant shopping centre, when Mayor Sadiq Khan [declined to intervene](https://www.docdroid.net/njfeOJz/3654.pdf#page=23) in the decision.  In doing so he followed Southwark Council in defying written objections from seven local ward & constituency level Labour parties [^ 1], two London Assembly members and over a thousand formal objections submitted by local people against [Delancey's disastrous redevelopment of the Elephant & Castle shopping centre](http://35percent.org/shopping-centre).

Come Tuesday, though, Delancey failed to secure planning approval for a vital condition of the shopping centre scheme.  [After a vibrant demonstration](https://twitter.com/uptheelephant_?lang=en&lang=en)outside Southwark's HQ in Tooley St, including impassioned speeches from the Latin American community,planning sub-committee B deferred a decision on Castle Square, the temporary relocation facility for displaced traders.  Delancey [must get this approval](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/mgAi.aspx?ID=49413), before it can go any further with the shopping centre redevelopment.

To make matters worse for Delancey it now looks certain that they will miss the [18 December deadline](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/mgAi.aspx?ID=49413) for concluding the legal S106 agreement that sets the seal on the planning approval. This missed deadline [puts the power to refuse](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/mgAi.aspx?ID=49413)the application into the hands of the Director of Planning.

He has every reason to do this, judging by what was [heard pn Tues evening](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1nAJEywMqObJL).  Council officers acknowledged that Castle Square would not be suitable for every kind of trader, but asserted that it was just one of the relocation options. Traders point out, though, that it is the only purpose-built option and after all are taken into account there is still a shortfall in floorspace (link Latin objection).

Close questioning from sub-committee members revealed other shortcomings, including an obvious one, that should larger traders take units in a yet to be settled flexixble design, the Square would accommodate a lot fewer traders overall.  [Distriandina](https://www.thecolombian.co.uk/), home to the Colombian cafe and restaurant, the 'Heart of Latin London', and currently occupying Arch 6, testified that Castle Square was not a feasible alternative for them. 

It has been apparent that Delancey have also dragged their feet setting up the Trader Panel, which has meant that traders have had little influence over the design of Castle Square, prompting several practical objections, such as lack of window space to display goods.  The Traders Panel has also not been able to address fundamental issues, like leases that provide some certainty beyond the life time of Castle Square and the rents to be paid.  This proved to be the biggest problem for sub-committee members.  Delancey claimed that the rents to be paid would be on a par with what is being at the moment by shopping centre, with officer's citing an average rent of £64psf.  This was fiercely contested by the Elephant Traders Association and the sub-committee deferred a decision to allow officers to gather more information.

The sub-committee is due to reconvene for a decision on Castle Square on 7 January 2018, other details to be announced.

## Mayor gives dire scheme his approval

Hopes that the Mayor would have the courage to reject the main shopping centre scheme, were sorely disappointed by his refusal to intervene.  It transpires that the [decision was passed on](http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/9772) to deputy mayor for planning Jules Pipe, when the Mayor cited a conflict of interest, being chair of TfL, who are party to the schemes s106 agreement, includin a deal with TfL for Delancey to provide a new Northern line tube entrance.  The decision remains the Mayor's, though, in a formal and legal sense.

The decision was announced in a statement that claimed several advantages and improvements including an extension to the length of time traders would benefit from below-market rents to 15 years.  This is better than the current 5 years, but its benefit depnds on what the market rent is taken to be, and the Castle Square meeting shows there is no agreement on this.  The statement also says that there will be _'35% social rent... or other genuinely affordable rent'_.  The [GLA Stage 2 report](https://www.docdroid.net/njfeOJz/3654.pdf#page=22) shows this to be [116 social rented units](https://www.docdroid.net/S6CBtQA/stage2-excerpt.pdf), which is neither more than there was when the decision was referred to the Mayor nor enough to meet Southwark's [planning policy](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning-policy-and-transport-policy/supplementary-planning-documents-spd/spd-by-area?chapter=6) which would require around 170 social rented homes.  The top end cap for discounted market rent aka affordable rent has been reduced from £90k to £60k, but this makes for a 'genuinely affordable rent' only in th Mayor's imagination.

TfL trumps locals

We need a better entrance to the Northern Line, but the needs of traders and local people have been sacrificed to secure it.

This is a chance for a refusal and it should be taken. All the big beasts - the Mayor, GLA, TfL, UAL, Southwark -  have been focussed on what they can get out of the development, in the shape of new tube stations and university campuses, and what are grandly known as 'strategic issues', at the expense of local traders and real affordable housing.  They all supported the scheme with little reservation when it first came forward and it took the local community to step forward to wrest a few small, but important concessions, from Delancey, through outright opposition.  The scheme though largely remains as it was, though.  

Come the 19 December,Southwark can redeem itself by finally putting this scheme to a merciful end.  It must not be allowed to destroy the long-standing, vibrant mixed Elephant and Castle community low-income community, the Mayor

that enjoys negligible local support
