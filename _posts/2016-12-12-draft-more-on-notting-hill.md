As we [reported in December](http://35percent.org/2016-12-12-ombudsman-slams-southwark-for-no-s106-monitoring/), Southwark has been slammed by the ombudsman for having no monitoring or enforcement of affordable housing provision. It had been relying on the good faith of developers and housing associations to provide the affordable housing in planning consents by the Council's planning committee.

The ombudsman has directed the Council to conduct an audit, but hasn't set a deadline for it.
Meanwhile, we are continuing to add to the list of breaches we submitted to the council. This time we have come across a new-build flat at Elephant & Castle, which was supposed to be let at intermediate rent to families on the Council's waiting list. Instead it has been sold on the open market and is currently being used as a full-time AirBNB let at 129 per night.

There is a housing crisis. Southwark needs to get its act together, complete this audit and take enforcement action to return this lost affordable housing to those in housing need.

## Not just Southwark
What we haven't mentioned before is that this 'tenure switch' practice appears to 
extend to beyond Southwark and it appears that Lambeth is having the wool 
pulled over its eyes by Notting Hill too.

In 2013, Lambeth Council [sold](/img/LRclaremontgarages.pdf) land on its 
Claremont East estate in Brixton Hill to Notting Hill Housing for the knock 
down price of £1.5m, on the basis that it would provide 100% social rented 
housing.

Lambeth's planning committee had previously 
[resolved](https://moderngov.lambeth.gov.uk/mgAi.aspx?ID=13743) to grant 
Notting Hill consent to build on the garages site, on the basis that 70% of the 
affordable housing built would be social rented.

report](https://moderngov.lambeth.gov.uk/mgAi.aspx?ID=13743)* 

However, [GLA 
data](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/gla-affordable-housing-programme-outturn/resource/0c87e5dc-f1e9-4edf-b246-bef6b40a9ba3) 
shows that these have been provided instead as affordable rent (charging up to 68% 
market rent).

Likewise, Lambeth's [Planning Committee 
report](https://moderngov.lambeth.gov.uk/mgConvert2PDF.aspx?ID=16725) for 
Notting Hill's 'Fabrik' development on Coldharbour lane shows it was given 
consent for 43 social rented homes. We understand from the CORE lettings data 
system that a number of these are now being let at affordable rent. 

Notting Hill is open about its [pipeline of new 
homes](http://www.cih.org/resources/PDF/Event%20pdfs/Presentations/Developing%20affordable%20housing/Andy%20Belton.pdf) 
providing only for affordable rent rather than social rent.

We are under no doubt what type of 'social' housing Notting Hill is planning to 
provide on the redeveloped [Wood 
Dene](http://35percent.org/wood-dene-estate-regeneration/) and Aylesbury 
estates.

## Key drivers
Notting Hill is by far London's largest housing association and one of the key drivers behind the 
[g15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G15_%28housing_associations%29) – who 
represent London’s largest housing associations. Last week it [launched a 
report](https://www.nhhg.org.uk/news/news/all/meeting-the-challenges-of-urban-renewal/) 
which documents 35 of estate regeneration projects across London. It highlights 
the importance of estate regeneration in solving the capital’s housing crisis 
and identifies what is required to deliver more. We note that the g15 report 
was also authored with the help of Southwark's Director of Housing & 
Modernisation Gerri Scott[^1]. 

The report repeats all of the usual right wing arguments against council 
estates: create mixed communities; replace poor quality housing; address social 
deprivation etc, etc.

The report goes on to make 5 recommendations to policy makers for furthering estate renewal programmes. One of these asks for fewer restrictions over rent levels:

This echoes Notting Hill CEO Kate Davies' call for less rent control in the [policy paper](http://www.centreforsocialjustice.org.uk/UserStorage/pdf/Pdf%20reports/HousingPoverty.pdf) she co-authored with Iain Duncan-Smith for the CSJ think tank.

## St James Place
St James Place estate is a good example of what happens when Notting Hill takes over an estate from the local authority and is free to sent rent levels without restrictions. Rent hikes of xx have resulted in a spate of evictions. http://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/housing-association-slammed-nightmare-scenario-eviction-threat-bermondseys-st-james-estate/

CHECK OUT THESE, maybe we can figure out the rent increase and also extract weekly rents from this:
