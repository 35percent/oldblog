We [reported in December](http://35percent.org/2016-12-12-ombudsman-slams-southwark-for-no-s106-monitoring/) how Southwark Council has been slammed by the ombudsman for having no monitoring or enforcement of section 106 affordable housing provision. 

Last week it was [revealed](http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/two-further-councils-have-no-section-106-monitoring/7018287.article) by Inside Housing magazine, that two further London boroughs have no S106 monitoring or enforcement procedures (Bexley & Redbridge). This week we can add two more boroughs to the list - Lambeth and Greenwich. 

During the course of our research into tenure breaches in Southwark we stumbled upon two estate regeneration schemes in these boroughs, where affordable rent has been provided in place of the social rented tenure required by the respective planning consents.

## Ferrier estate (Greenwich)
The first of these is the [ferrier estate regeneration](https://halag.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/ferrier.pdf) in Greenwich, where 1,906 council homes have been knocked down and are being replaced with a 'mixed tenure' scheme of 4,398 homes.

The most recent phase (4a) of the scheme to be completed is ['Kidbrooke Village'](https://www.berkeleygroup.co.uk/new-homes/london/greenwich/kidbrooke-village) where Berkeley Homes was granted planning consent in 2012 for 374 units. Berkeley's [planning application](https://planning.royalgreenwich.gov.uk/online-applications/files/591F8EE5C657B23BE9EBFC830D333E93/pdf/11_2366_O-Planning_Statement-64751.pdf) clearly states that 67 of these would be social rented homes:

This is also confirmed in the [Mayor's planning report](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/PAWS/media_id_127252/kidbrooke_phase_4_report.pdf) for the application:

However, the [GLA affordable housing dataset](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/gla-affordable-housing-programme-outturn/resource/0c87e5dc-f1e9-4edf-b246-bef6b40a9ba3) shows these 67 'social rented' units provided as affordable rent of up to 62% market rent.

## Claremont East estate (Lambeth)
Lambeth claims to have section 106 monitoring procedures.
We can show that they are clearly not effective. 

In 2013, Lambeth Council [sold](/img/LRclaremontgarages.pdf) land on its Claremont East estate in Brixton Hill to Notting Hill Housing for the knock down price of £1.5m, on the basis that it would provide 100% social rented housing.

*Extract from [planning committee minutes](https://moderngov.lambeth.gov.uk/mgAi.aspx?ID=13743)*

Despite having sold the land at a discount on the basis it would provide 100% social rented housing, Notting Hill submitted a viability assessment pleaded viability poverty and, which Lambeth's planning committee accepted and [resolved](https://moderngov.lambeth.gov.uk/mgAi.aspx?ID=13743) to grant Notting Hill consent on the basis that 40% of the new homes would be 'affordable' with 70% of these social rented.

However, [GLA data](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/gla-affordable-housing-programme-outturn/resource/0c87e5dc-f1e9-4edf-b246-bef6b40a9ba3) shows that these have been provided instead as affordable rent at rents of up to 68% market rent.

## Key drivers
Notting Hill is by far London's largest housing association and one of the key drivers behind the 
[g15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G15_%28housing_associations%29) – who 
represent London’s largest housing associations. Last week it [launched a 
report](https://www.nhhg.org.uk/news/news/all/meeting-the-challenges-of-urban-renewal/) 
which documents 35 of estate regeneration projects across London. It highlights 
the importance of estate regeneration in solving the capital’s housing crisis 
and identifies what is required to deliver more. We note that the g15 report 
was also authored with the help of Southwark's Director of Housing & 
Modernisation Gerri Scott[^1]. 

The report repeats all of the usual right wing arguments against council 
estates: create mixed communities; replace poor quality housing; address social 
deprivation etc, etc.

The report goes on to make 5 recommendations to policy makers for furthering estate renewal programmes. One of these asks for fewer restrictions over rent levels:

This echoes Notting Hill CEO Kate Davies' call for less rent control in the [policy paper](http://www.centreforsocialjustice.org.uk/UserStorage/pdf/Pdf%20reports/HousingPoverty.pdf) she co-authored with Iain Duncan-Smith for the CSJ think tank.

## St James Place
St James Place estate is a good example of what happens when Notting Hill takes over an estate from the local authority and is free to sent rent levels without restrictions. Rent hikes of xx have resulted in a spate of evictions. http://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/housing-association-slammed-nightmare-scenario-eviction-threat-bermondseys-st-james-estate/

CHECK OUT THESE, maybe we can figure out the rent increase and also extract weekly rents from this:
