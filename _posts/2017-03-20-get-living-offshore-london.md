Our last blog [reported](http://35percent.org/2017-03-12-delanceys-dirty-tricks/) how Delancey  has shown great efficiency in its [__Elephant One__ development](/tribeca-square). Delancey bought the land for £8m, flipped it between companies, increasing the value to £18m and used this cost, amongst others, to avoid paying £58m of planning contributions, including affordable housing contributions [^1].  Along the way it gained the almost free use of another half an acre of public land, which it was to provide as a market square, but has now disappeared.

We have also [shown previously](http://35percent.org/2014-05-05-manx-connections-the-off-shore-home-of-the-elephants-developers/) how, having bought the Elephant One land for just £8m, Delancey has used a network of offshore companies registered in Panama and Bermuda to avoid paying corporation tax on developing the £200m scheme.

Delancey now wants to redevelop the Elephant & Castle [shopping centre](shopping-centre), and is showing  equal efficiency in the management of the housing it proposes to build there. It will be using __Get Living London__ a residential owner and rental management company founded by itself and Qatari Diar.  __Get Living London's__ parent company is registered of-shore and it has not paid any corporation tax since being incorporated in 2011.  It will own and manage all the 979 new housing units  in the [shopping centre](shopping-centre), including the affordable housing. 

__Get Living London__ already manages the 646 dwellings in Elephant One [__Elephant One__](tribeca-square), just next to the shopping centre and all the housing on both sites will be marketed as 'South Village'. Elephant One also includes 274 student rooms, which are being let at rents from  £279pw ('Classic') to £349PW ('Supreme'). 

__Get Living London__ also manages just over 1400 rented apartments at ['East Village'](http://eastvillagelondon.co.uk), formerly the Olympic Village, with another 2000 in the pipeline. 

Despite this huge rental portfolio, [valued at £1bn](http://www.propertyweek.com/news/get-living-to-double-assets-to-%C2%A32bn/5088136.article), __Get Living London__ has not paid any corporation tax since it was incorporated in 2011, according to [accounts filed at Companies House](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/07793925/filing-history), which also show that the parent company __DV4__ is registered offshore in the British Virgin Islands. DV4 was accused of 'aggressive tax avoidance' by the HMRC, as [reported in Private Eye](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/PrivateEyeNo1311.pdf).

With all this tax-free profit oozing out of London's burgeoning private rental sector, Build-to-Rent as it is know, is currently in vogue with London's developers. These are 100% rental developments with no homes for sale, backed up by large institutional investors and owned and managed by one landlord. It also provides a new kind of affordable housing; Discounted Market Rent (DMR). This is in every respect inferior to every other kind of affordable housing, being more expensive, less secure and remaining 'affordable' for a relatively short period of time. 

It will be let at up to 80% on max. 3 year tenancies and might only remain 'affordable' for 15 years before passing onto the free market. This is compared to social rents, with rents largely based on local income and at an equivalent of about 25% market in Southwark, with lifetime tenancies and remaining affordable in perpetuity. It is therefore surprising or maybe not, that Discounted Market Rent is the housing solution of the future by Labour Mayor [Sadiq Khan](https://www.lettingagenttoday.co.uk/breaking-news/2016/10/sadiq-khan-backs-build-to-rent-and-more-landlord-licensing), Deputy Mayor [James Murray](https://twitter.com/nlalondon/status/842315679948771328), GLA Housing Chief [Tom Copley](https://twitter.com/tomcopley), [Southwark Council](http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/southwark-council-to-create-intermediate-waiting-list/7018529.article).

For a supposedly market-based solution, Build-to-Rent depends upon a surprisingly large amount of public money. 

Delancey's Ritblat family [among the top 100 Tory donors] it's no wonder the government has allocated a staggering £3.5bn in grant funding to the sector.





[__Elephant One__ development](/tribeca-square) at the Elephant and how they had wangled half an acre of public land, while dodging £58m of planning contributions.





This week we show how __Get Living London__, its PRS firm that will manage __Elephant One__'s 646 Private Rented Sector units and the 979 new units proposed above the new [shopping centre](/shopping-centre), pays no corporation tax - .



Delancey [bought the completed Olympic Village](http://www.stratfordlondon.info/news/olympic-village-sold-qatari-diar-delancey-consortium) (after it received £275m in govt subsidies). It has been letting the development's xxx PRS properties via [Get Living London](http://www.delancey.com/GeLiving_London_Launch_PR.pdf) since 201X, with rents starting at £385 per week for a 1-bedroom flat. 

 

What is more difficult to understand is why Sadiq Khan is so keen on it. His Housing Spokesperson uses a picture of Delancey's __Get Living London__ Athlete's village complex on his Twitter profile?

Tom Copley's [response](http://tomcopley.com/response-mayors-draft-affordable-housing-viability-supplementary-planning-guidance/) to the Mayor's new Affordable Housing SPG lobbied for using a new term 'London Social Rent' to replace London Affordable Rent.

*Extract from Tom Copley's [response](http://tomcopley.com/response-mayors-draft-affordable-housing-viability-supplementary-planning-guidance/) to the SPG*

Tom described the new product by [saying](https://twitter.com/tomcopley/status/842031557284118528)
_"London Affordable Rent AR is tied to capped social rents. It is effectively social rent."_

We pointed out that the Mayor's [policy definition](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/homesforlondoners-affordablehomesprogrammefundingguidance.pdf) doesn't say this. What it does say is that the Mayor _"expects most homes let for London Affordable Rent to be substantially below"_ the 80% market rent level. It says that current social rent levels will be the __'Starting point'__ for London Affordable Rent levels but that _"other rent levels will also be considered .. where provider is able to demonstrate to the GLA's satisfaction that the homes would be genuinely affordable."_

It also makes it clear that the tenure product is affordable rent and is regulated as such, i.e. subject to rebasing and all the other nasty small print in the Social Housing Regulator's Affordable Rent guidance.

Student rooms at [Portchester House](/img/portchester-house-guide.pdf) start at £289 per week




## Misc
We don't know how much the PRS units will be but we do know that __Get Living London__ is advertising them at its 'East Village' (aka Athlete's village) for upwards of £385 per week.

Where is the cinema?
The 2008 final consent included a cinema but there's no sign of it yet..

It has been confirmed that there will be a gym, but there is no consent for a gym in the 2008 permission.

There is consent for a créche - maybe this will now be a gym?

S106 agreement says that the affordable retail units will be offered to traders 'not later than 15 months prior to estimated completion'. There are four affordable retail units on very good discounts for 5 years. Also one restaurant.
