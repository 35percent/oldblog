Our last blog [reported](http://35percent.org/2017-03-12-delanceys-dirty-tricks/) how Delancey  has shown great efficiency in its [__Elephant One__ development](/tribeca-square). Delancey bought the site for £8m and increased the purchase price to £18m by flipping it between companies. This was then used to avoid paying £58m of planning contributions, including affordable housing[^1]. Along the way it gained half an acre of public land, which it was to provide as a market square, but has since ditched the market.

We have also [shown previously](http://35percent.org/2014-05-05-manx-connections-the-off-shore-home-of-the-elephants-developers/) how Delancey, having bought the Elephant One land for just £8m, has used a network of offshore companies registered in Panama and Bermuda to avoid paying corporation tax on developing the £200m scheme.

Delancey is now showing equal tax efficiency in the housing it proposes to build on the redeveloped Elephant and Castle [shopping centre](shopping-centre). It will be using __Get Living London Ltd__, a company founded by itself and Qatari Diar, as owner and manager of the all the 979 units of housing in the new development, including the 'affordable' housing.

__Get Living London__ already manages the 646 dwellings in [__Elephant One__](tribeca-square), just next to the shopping centre and all the housing on both sites will be marketed as 'South Village'. The development includes 274 student rooms, which __Get Living London__ [lets at rents](http://www.portchesterhouse.com/) of  £279pw for a 'Classic' room, or £349pw for a 'Supreme'. 

Over in Stratford __Get Living London__ also lets just over 1400 private rented apartments at ['East Village'](http://eastvillagelondon.co.uk), formerly the Olympic Village, with a further 2000 in the pipeline. 

Despite this huge rental portfolio, [valued at £1bn](http://www.propertyweek.com/news/get-living-to-double-assets-to-%C2%A32bn/5088136.article), __Get Living London__ has not paid any corporation tax since it was incorporated in 2011, according to [accounts filed at Companies House](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/07793925/filing-history). This is because its two 'ultimate parent' companies are based offshore, one in Qatar and the other __DV4__, in the British Virgin Islands. __DV4__ is Delancey's offshore arm that has been accused of 'aggressive tax avoidance' by the HMRC, as [reported in Private Eye](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/PrivateEyeNo1311.pdf).

Delancey's two developments comprising 1600 new homes for rent at the Elephant (or 'South Village') are known in the industry as Build to Rent (BtR). With all the tax-free profit to be squeezed out of London's burgeoning private rental sector,  BtR is in vogue with London's developers. BtR developments are 100% rental, with no homes for sale, backed up by large institutional investors and owned and managed by one (private) landlord. 

BtR is also giving us a new kind of affordable housing -  Discounted Market Rent (DMR). DMR is similiar to the much derided affordable rent and compares badly with social rent.  Like affordable rent, DMR can be let at up to 80% market rent, but with a likely 3 year tenancy, and only remaining 'affordable' for 15 years, before passing onto the free market. Social rent levels are largely based on local incomes, giving an equivalent of about 25% market rent in Southwark.  Social rented housing still has lifetime tenancies and remains affordable in perpetuity. 

It is therefore surprising (or maybe not) that Discounted Market Rent is viewed as the housing solution for the future by [Southwark Council](http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/southwark-council-to-create-intermediate-waiting-list/7018529.article), Labour Mayor [Sadiq Khan](https://www.lettingagenttoday.co.uk/breaking-news/2016/10/sadiq-khan-backs-build-to-rent-and-more-landlord-licensing), Deputy Mayor [James Murray](https://twitter.com/nlalondon/status/842315679948771328), GLA Housing Chief [Tom Copley](https://twitter.com/tomcopley).  

Sadiq Khan is so enthusiastic for DMR he has given it help and space to grow, by halving the amount of social rented housing he wants from developers in his [draft affordable housing planning guidance](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/draft_affordable_housing_and_viability_spg_2016.pdf)[^2].  

Delancey  has taken full advantage of Mr Khan's largesse and proposed no social rented housing in its redevelopment of the shopping centre and, if approved, their scheme will join another BtR development, the [360 Tower](http://35percent.org/london-360-tower/), just over the way at St Mary's Park and built on land bought with £18m of public money, but also social housing free.

We understand that the Mayor and his Labour Party colleagues are motivated by pragmatism. But while Build to Rent is supposedly a market-based solution to the housing crisis, drawing on institutional investment, it also depends upon a large amount of public money - [£3.5bn, probably rising to £6.6bn](http://www.ukconstructionmedia.co.uk/news/3-5bn-funding-announced-build-new-rented-homes/), while social rented housing is starved of funds.  We think that the Mayor should stop championing Build to Rent and start fighting to build social rented housing.

Discounted Market Rent is designed to meet developer's needs first and our housing needs second. We can help stop DMR'S roll-out across London and the further maginalisation of social rented housing by defeating Delancey's plans for the Elephant and Castle shopping Centre; we have launched a campaign group to this end ([www.uptheelephant.com](http://uptheelephant.com)). You can support us by lodging an objection using our [online web form](http://35percent.org/shopping-centre/#object-now) or come to our [public meeting tomorrow night](http://35percent.org/img/march21flyer.pdf) at the shopping centre.
