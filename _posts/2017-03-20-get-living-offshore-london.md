Our last blog [reported](http://35percent.org/2017-03-12-delanceys-dirty-tricks/) how Delancey  has shown great efficiency in its [__Elephant One__ development](/tribeca-square). Delancey bought the land for £8m, flipped it between companies, increasing the value to £18m and used this cost, amongst others, to avoid paying £58m of planning contributions, including affordable housing contributions [^1].  Along the way it gained the almost free use of another half an acre of public land, which it was to provide as a market square, but has now disappeared.

We have also [shown previously](http://35percent.org/2014-05-05-manx-connections-the-off-shore-home-of-the-elephants-developers/) how, having bought the Elephant One land for just £8m, Delancey has used a network of offshore companies registered in Panama and Bermuda to avoid paying corporation tax on developing the £200m scheme.

Delancey is now showing  equal efficiency in the housing it proposes to build on a redeveloped Elephant and Castle [shopping centre](shopping-centre). It will be using __Get Living London__, a company founded by itself and Qatari Diar, as owner and manager of the all the 979 units of housing in the new development, including the affordable housing.  __Get Living London's__ parent company is registered off-shore and it has not paid any corporation tax since being incorporated in 2011.

__Get Living London__ already manages the 646 dwellings in Elephant One [__Elephant One__](tribeca-square), just next to the shopping centre and all the housing on both sites will be marketed as 'South Village'. Elephant One also includes 274 student rooms, which are being let at rents from  £279pw ('Classic') to £349PW ('Supreme'). 

Over in Stratford __Get Living London__ also manages just over 1400 rented apartments at ['East Village'](http://eastvillagelondon.co.uk), formerly the Olympic Village, with further 2000 in the pipeline. 

Despite this huge rental portfolio, [valued at £1bn](http://www.propertyweek.com/news/get-living-to-double-assets-to-%C2%A32bn/5088136.article), __Get Living London__ has not paid any corporation tax since 2011, according to [accounts filed at Companies House](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/07793925/filing-history), because the parent company __DV4__ is registered offshore in the British Virgin Islands. DV4 is another Delancey company and was accused of 'aggressive tax avoidance' by the HMRC, as [reported in Private Eye](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/PrivateEyeNo1311.pdf).

With all this tax-free profit to be squeezed out of London's burgeoning private rental sector, Build-to-Rent (BtR) as it is known, is currently in vogue with London's developers. BtR developments are 100% rental, with no homes for sale, backed up by large institutional investors and owned and managed by one landlord. BtR is also giving us a new kind of affordable housing; Discounted Market Rent (DMR). Discounted Market Rent is similiar to the much derided affordable rent. It can also be let at up to 80% on a minimum 3 year tenancies and might only remain 'affordable' for 15 years before passing onto the free market. This is compared to social rents, with rents largely based on local income and at an equivalent of about 25% market in Southwark, with lifetime tenancies and remaining affordable in perpetuity. 

It is therefore surprising or maybe not, that Discounted Market Rent is viewed as the housing solution for the future by [Southwark Council](http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/southwark-council-to-create-intermediate-waiting-list/7018529.article), Labour Mayor [Sadiq Khan](https://www.lettingagenttoday.co.uk/breaking-news/2016/10/sadiq-khan-backs-build-to-rent-and-more-landlord-licensing), Deputy Mayor [James Murray](https://twitter.com/nlalondon/status/842315679948771328), GLA Housing Chief [Tom Copley](https://twitter.com/tomcopley).  Sadiq Khan is so enthusiastic he has given DMR some space and help to grow by halving the amount of social rented housing he wants from developers in his [draft affordable housing planning guidance](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/draft_affordable_housing_and_viability_spg_2016.pdf)[^2]. Delancey  has taken full advantage of Mr Khan's largesse and there will be no social rented housing in its redevelopment of the shopping centre. If Delancey's planning application is approved it will join the [360 Tower](http://35percent.org/london-360-tower/) another BtR develoment,just over the way at St Mary's Park, another BtR development, built on land bought with £18m of public money, but also social housing free.

We understand that the Mayor and his Labour Party colleagues are motivated by pragmatism. But while Build to Rent is supposedly a market-based solution to the housing crisis, drawing on institutional investment, it also depends upon a large amount of public money - [£3.5bn, probably rising to £6.6bn](http://www.ukconstructionmedia.co.uk/news/3-5bn-funding-announced-build-new-rented-homes/), while social rented housing is starved of funds.  We think that the Mayor should stop championing Build to Rent and start fighting to build social rented housing. 


can get money for BtR, with some  Discounted Market Rent, hen they can't get money to build social rent.  But for a supposedly market-based solution, drawing funds from big investors,(http://www.ukconstructionmedia.co.uk/news/3-5bn-funding-announced-build-new-rented-homes/).  We think that this is money that would be better spent on social rented housing and that it was the Mayor shouldb fighting for.







[__Elephant One__ development](/tribeca-square) at the Elephant and how they had wangled half an acre of public land, while dodging £58m of planning contributions.





This week we show how __Get Living London__, its PRS firm that will manage __Elephant One__'s 646 Private Rented Sector units and the 979 new units proposed above the new [shopping centre](/shopping-centre), pays no corporation tax - .



Delancey [bought the completed Olympic Village](http://www.stratfordlondon.info/news/olympic-village-sold-qatari-diar-delancey-consortium) (after it received £275m in govt subsidies). It has been letting the development's xxx PRS properties via [Get Living London](http://www.delancey.com/GeLiving_London_Launch_PR.pdf) since 201X, with rents starting at £385 per week for a 1-bedroom flat. 

 

What is more difficult to understand is why Sadiq Khan is so keen on it. His Housing Spokesperson uses a picture of Delancey's __Get Living London__ Athlete's village complex on his Twitter profile?

Tom Copley's [response](http://tomcopley.com/response-mayors-draft-affordable-housing-viability-supplementary-planning-guidance/) to the Mayor's new Affordable Housing SPG lobbied for using a new term 'London Social Rent' to replace London Affordable Rent.

*Extract from Tom Copley's [response](http://tomcopley.com/response-mayors-draft-affordable-housing-viability-supplementary-planning-guidance/) to the SPG*

Tom described the new product by [saying](https://twitter.com/tomcopley/status/842031557284118528)
_"London Affordable Rent AR is tied to capped social rents. It is effectively social rent."_

We pointed out that the Mayor's [policy definition](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/homesforlondoners-affordablehomesprogrammefundingguidance.pdf) doesn't say this. What it does say is that the Mayor _"expects most homes let for London Affordable Rent to be substantially below"_ the 80% market rent level. It says that current social rent levels will be the __'Starting point'__ for London Affordable Rent levels but that _"other rent levels will also be considered .. where provider is able to demonstrate to the GLA's satisfaction that the homes would be genuinely affordable."_

It also makes it clear that the tenure product is affordable rent and is regulated as such, i.e. subject to rebasing and all the other nasty small print in the Social Housing Regulator's Affordable Rent guidance.

Student rooms at [Portchester House](/img/portchester-house-guide.pdf) start at £289 per week




## Misc
We don't know how much the PRS units will be but we do know that __Get Living London__ is advertising them at its 'East Village' (aka Athlete's village) for upwards of £385 per week.

Where is the cinema?
The 2008 final consent included a cinema but there's no sign of it yet..

It has been confirmed that there will be a gym, but there is no consent for a gym in the 2008 permission.

There is consent for a créche - maybe this will now be a gym?

S106 agreement says that the affordable retail units will be offered to traders 'not later than 15 months prior to estimated completion'. There are four affordable retail units on very good discounts for 5 years. Also one restaurant.
