Last week we [reported](http://35percent.org/2017-03-12-delanceys-dirty-tricks/) on Delancey's [__Elephant One__ development](/tribeca-square) at the Elephant and how they had wangled half an acre of public land, while dodging £58m of planning contributions.

We have also [shown previously]() how, having bought the land for just £8m, Delancey has used a network of offshore companies registered in Panama and Bermuda to avoid paying corporation tax on developing the £200m scheme.

This week we show how __Get Living London__, its PRS firm that will manage __Elephant One__'s 646 Private Rented Sector units and the 979 new units proposed above the new [shopping centre](/shopping-centre), pays no corporation tax - despite [managing a £1bn PRS rental portfolio](http://www.propertyweek.com/news/get-living-to-double-assets-to-%C2%A32bn/5088136.article).

[Accounts filed at Companies House](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/07793925/filing-history) show that __Get Living London__ has never paid a penny of corporation tax. They also show that another Delancey company __DV4__ registered in the British Virgin Islands is the ultimate parent company for tax purposes.

DV4 [featured in Private Eye](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/PrivateEyeNo1311.pdf) after it was accused of 'aggressive tax avoidance' by HMRC. 

Delancey [bought the completed Olympic Village](http://www.stratfordlondon.info/news/olympic-village-sold-qatari-diar-delancey-consortium) (after it received £275m in govt subsidies). It has been letting the development's xxx PRS properties via [Get Living London](http://www.delancey.com/GeLiving_London_Launch_PR.pdf) since 201X, with rents starting at £385 per week for a 1-bedroom flat. 

With tax-free profits to be squeezed out of London's burgeoning private rental sector, Build-to-Rent is currently in vogue with London's developers and with Delancey's Ritblat family [among the top 100 Tory donors] it's no wonder the government has allocated a staggering £3.5bn in grant funding to the sector. 

What is more difficult to understand is why Sadiq Khan is so keen on it. His Housing Spokesperson uses a picture of Delancey's __Get Living London__ Athlete's village complex on his Twitter profile?

Tom Copley's [response](http://tomcopley.com/response-mayors-draft-affordable-housing-viability-supplementary-planning-guidance/) to the Mayor's new Affordable Housing SPG lobbied for using a new term 'London Social Rent' to replace London Affordable Rent.

*Extract from Tom Copley's [response](http://tomcopley.com/response-mayors-draft-affordable-housing-viability-supplementary-planning-guidance/) to the SPG*

Tom described the new product by [saying](https://twitter.com/tomcopley/status/842031557284118528)
_"London Affordable Rent AR is tied to capped social rents. It is effectively social rent."_

We pointed out that the Mayor's [policy definition](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/homesforlondoners-affordablehomesprogrammefundingguidance.pdf) doesn't say this. What it does say is that the Mayor _"expects most homes let for London Affordable Rent to be substantially below"_ the 80% market rent level. It says that current social rent levels will be the __'Starting point'__ for London Affordable Rent levels but that _"other rent levels will also be considered .. where provider is able to demonstrate to the GLA's satisfaction that the homes would be genuinely affordable."_

It also makes it clear that the tenure product is affordable rent and is regulated as such, i.e. subject to rebasing and all the other nasty small print in the Social Housing Regulator's Affordable Rent guidance.

Student rooms at [Portchester House](/img/portchester-house-guide.pdf) start at £289 per week




## Misc
We don't know how much the PRS units will be but we do know that __Get Living London__ is advertising them at its 'East Village' (aka Athlete's village) for upwards of £385 per week.

Where is the cinema?
The 2008 final consent included a cinema but there's no sign of it yet..

It has been confirmed that there will be a gym, but there is no consent for a gym in the 2008 permission.

There is consent for a créche - maybe this will now be a gym?

S106 agreement says that the affordable retail units will be offered to traders 'not later than 15 months prior to estimated completion'. There are four affordable retail units on very good discounts for 5 years. Also one restaurant.
