Last week we [reported](http://35percent.org/2017-03-12-delanceys-dirty-tricks/) on Delancey's £200m __Elephant One__ development at the Elephant and how it had wangled half an acre of public land, while dodging £58m of planning contributions.

This week we show how Delancey's PRS firm which is managing the new 

Student rooms at [Portchester House](/img/portchester-house-guide.pdf) start at £289 per week


Officers report says 243 student rooms http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/Tribeca_OfficersReport.pdf

But Oakmayne says 272 http://oakmayneproperties.com/oakmayne-properties/portfolio/tribeca-square/
Also Delancey says 272 http://www.elephantandcastletowncentre.co.uk/phase1.htm
Delancey's main website says 278 http://www.delancey.com/elephant-and-castle-redevelopment.html

They also say 374 private market residences but the Officer's report says 373.

We don't know how much the PRS units will be but we do know that __Get Living London__ is advertising them at its 'East Village' (aka Athlete's village) for upwards of £385 per week.

Where is the cinema?
The 2008 final consent included a cinema but there's no sign of it yet..

It has been confirmed that there will be a gym, but there is no consent for a gym in the 2008 permission.

There is consent for a créche - maybe this will now be a gym?

S106 agreement says that the affordable retail units will be offered to traders 'not later than 15 months prior to estimated completion'. There are four affordable retail units on very good discounts for 5 years. Also one restaurant.
