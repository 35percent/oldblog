Last week we [reported](http://35percent.org/2017-03-12-delanceys-dirty-tricks/) on Delancey's __Elephant One__ development at the Elephant and how it had wangled half an acre of public land, while dodging £58m of planning contributions.

We also showed previously how Delancey has used a network of offshore companies in Panama and Bermuda to avoid paying any corporation tax on developing the £200m scheme.

This week we show how its PRS management firm that will manage the 650 units in __Elephant One__ and the 979 new units proposed for the [shopping centre](/shopping-centre), pays no corporation tax on its £1bn PRS rental portfolio.

Delancey uses separate companies to own and separate companies to develop its sites. __Elephant One__ is owned by a Delancey shell company registered in the British Virgin Islands.

It has used a [limited partnership company (LLP) controlled by parent companies](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/OC389454/officers) registered in the British Virgin Islands and Panama. [Filing records at Companies House](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/OC389454/filing-history) show that the partnership company hasn't paid a penny of corporation tax. One of the partnerships' ultimate shareholders is listed as 'Kintyre Corp' - registered in Panama.

__Kintrye Corp__ is also named in the 'Panama Papers' scandal, which exposed how some of the world’s most powerful people may have used offshore bank accounts and shell companies to conceal their wealth or avoid taxes.

## Get living London!
Delancey also uses a separate company __Get Living London__ to manage its PRS (Private Rented Sector) build-to-rent homes. Despite [managing over £1bn worth of PRS homes](http://www.propertyweek.com/news/get-living-to-double-assets-to-%C2%A32bn/5088136.article) __Get Living London__ has [never paid a penny of corporation tax](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/07793925/filing-history).

Delancey's founder and CEO is Jamie Ritblat, son of property tycoon John Ritblat (British Land), which the Council has selected as its development partner for its [Canada Water regeneration](http://35percent.org/canada-water/#british-land-masterplan-site). The father and son team are long-standing Tory donors who are among the top 100 donors to the party.

Lendlease has no inhibitions about profiting from public assets though. As well as the Heygate and ['One the Elephant'](http://www.35percent.org/2014-01-11-flogging-the-elephant) developments - both on public land - it was Lend Lease's development arm which [bought](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/millennium-dome-the-white-elephant-that-learnt-to-fly-8157301.html) the Millenium dome plus 150 acres of Greenwich Peninsula for the princely sum of just £1. It [built the Olympic Village](http://www.thelondonmagazine.co.uk/property-experts/expert-opinions/the-olympic-village.html) with the help of hundreds of millions in public funding, and has used more former public land for a [£1.3bn scheme](http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=186950&p=RssLanding&cat=news&id=1888917) at Stratford.  

Lendlease subsequently [sold the completed Olympic Village to Delancey](http://www.stratfordlondon.info/news/olympic-village-sold-qatari-diar-delancey-consortium), which has been managing it via a subsidiary company called [Get Living London](http://www.delancey.com/GeLiving_London_Launch_PR.pdf), which has also never paid a penny in corporation tax. 

So the question is this: why is Southwark Council bending over backwards to make planning policy concessions and exercise CPO powers for developers that don't pay tax - and siphon all profit not just out of the Elephant, but out of the country? 

One can see why the govt is so keen on PRS given that one of its top Tory donors is the Ritblat family. What is more difficult to understand is why Sadiq Khan is so keen on it.

Tom Copley's [response](http://tomcopley.com/response-mayors-draft-affordable-housing-viability-supplementary-planning-guidance/) to the Mayor's new Affordable Housing SPG lobbied for using a new term 'London Social Rent' to replace London Affordable Rent.

*Extract from Tom Copley's [response](http://tomcopley.com/response-mayors-draft-affordable-housing-viability-supplementary-planning-guidance/) to the SPG*

Tom described the new product by [saying](https://twitter.com/tomcopley/status/842031557284118528)
_"London Affordable Rent AR is tied to capped social rents. It is effectively social rent."_

We pointed out that the Mayor's [policy definition](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/homesforlondoners-affordablehomesprogrammefundingguidance.pdf) doesn't say this. What it does say is that the Mayor _"expects most homes let for London Affordable Rent to be substantially below"_ the 80% market rent level. It says that current social rent levels will be the __'Starting point'__ for London Affordable Rent levels but that _"other rent levels will also be considered .. where provider is able to demonstrate to the GLA's satisfaction that the homes would be genuinely affordable."_

It also makes it clear that the tenure product is affordable rent and is regulated as such, i.e. subject to rebasing and all the other nasty small print in the Social Housing Regulator's Affordable Rent guidance.

## Misc
We don't know how much the PRS units will be but we do know that __Get Living London__ is advertising them at its 'East Village' (aka Athlete's village) for upwards of £385 per week.

Where is the cinema?
The 2008 final consent included a cinema but there's no sign of it yet..

It has been confirmed that there will be a gym, but there is no consent for a gym in the 2008 permission.

There is consent for a créche - maybe this will now be a gym?

S106 agreement says that the affordable retail units will be offered to traders 'not later than 15 months prior to estimated completion'. There are four affordable retail units on very good discounts for 5 years. Also one restaurant.
