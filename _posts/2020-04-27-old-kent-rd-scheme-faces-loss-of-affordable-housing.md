## Berkeley Homes threatens to reduce affordable housing at Malt St

Berkeley Homes (link) has the honour of being the first developer in Southwark  to threaten to reduce the affordable housing in one of its schemes, since the onset of the Coronavirus crisis.  Berkeley secured planning permission for the [Malt St development](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications-old/simpleSearchResults.do?action=firstPage), just off the Old Kent Rd, in June 2019 (links), with a promise to build 40% affordable housing.  Now a planning committee report (link) reveals that this affordable housing is at 'risk', because Berkeley intends to mount an appeal that will reopen the question of the viability of the scheme.  To prevent this from happening, the report recommends that Southwark approve an unprecedented clause in its planning agreement with Berkely that could see all the affordable housing lost, should Berkely's development partner, Peabody (link), hit financial trouble.

Peabody had its own planning permission for a development next door to Malt St - Nyes Wharf - and sold this to Berkeley, uniting the two developments.  Together the two sites will deliver 1,569 new homes, of which 581 will be affordable (359 at social rent and 222 shared-ownership), delivered by Peabody.

## Why a Mortagee in Possession (MIP) clause matters

Southwark's planning committee is being asked to approve a so-called [Mortgagee in Possession (MIP)](https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100211114) clause, in the legal s106 agreement for the joint site.  Simply put, if a borrower cannot pay their mortgage, then the lender can take legal possession of the property and sell it - they become the 'mortgagee in possession'.  Up until now this has evidently been covered in Southwark's 106 agreements with a clause that binds the mortgagee to any affordable housing obligations, so that that it remains affordable 'in perpetuity' and is protected; the s106 for the Aylesbury redevelopment is an example of this(link).

The MIP clause proposed for Malt St is different though - it will not secure the affordable housing in the event of Peabody defaulting; should this happen, Southwark would be given first option to take on the affordable housing itself, but if it could not or would not, the affordable housing could then be to be sold- off onto the open market.   

The MIP report is at pains to point out that such a situation is very unlikely to arise, because Peabody is in rude financial health; it has an annual turnover of £630m, an annual profit of £160m and assets of £7.6bn, so the possibility that it will fail is remote.  The report reinforces the point by noting that no major housing association has ever gone into administration and quotes a GLA document that says 'there is no known cases of a MIP clause being triggered.....'.

## Mayor of London opens the door...

This all begs an obvious question - why replace a MIP clause that protects affordable housing, in all circumstances, however unlikely, with one that does not?  

Part of the answer is that this is what the Mayor of London wants.  As Southwark's report explains it, the Mayor wants  _'a consistent approach to MIP clauses across the London boroughs and to secure greater access to funding for RPs (registered providers) to increase the delivery of affordable housing'_.  The report continues; _'In order to achieve this, the GLA MIP clause would allow, in certain limited and unlikely circumstances, affordable housing to no longer be “in perpetuity”'_ (para 8).  The report notes that Southwark's own MIP clause is different from the Mayor's, precisely on this point; Southwark **does** require affordable housing to remain such 'in perpetuity', should a RP go into administration (para 14). 

## Peabody takes advantage

Peabody also wants the GLA MIP, because it would allow it to borrow more money for other projects.  To quote the report _'Peabody have funds to deliver this scheme, but given the very large scale of the investment they are only willing to make such a commitment on the basis that they are able to secure additional funding in the future against the asset of the completed scheme'_ .  The report says that while the Malt St scheme is _'entirely financed by Peabody from its own investment'_ Peabody nonetheless wants more private bank finance and needs to make more of its _'capital assets'_. The banks, according to the report, do not consider the 'assets' _'sufficiently "liquid"_'.

## Berkeley turns the screw

To ensure there is no misunderstanding the report reiterates _'Peabody has confirmed that they cannot proceed as the RP [registered provider] partner in this scheme without this clause'_. Berkeley, in turn, backs Peabody to the hilt, saying that it cannot, or will not, proceed without them. Berkeley goes on to threaten to reduce the affordable housing in the scheme, if the pair of them do not get their way.  It would do this by way of an [appeal of 'non-determination'](https://www.planningportal.co.uk/info/200232/planning_applications/58/the_decision-making_process/8) to the governement, saying that Southwark have failed to conclude the s106 legal agreement in the required time, and taking the opportunity to reopen the question of the viability of the scheme.    Para 9, 12

## A triple threat - Southwark's arm being twisted

Southwark therefore appear to be caught between the Mayor's desire to 'promote a consistent approach' to , in favour of relieving developers of affordable housing where a MIP clause is triggered and two  

1 Mayor - policy note 'harmonising MIP' 2 Peabody - wants more 'liquid' assets through GLA MIP clause 3 Berkeley wanted Nyes Wharf, so is backing Peabody with threat of 'non-determination appeal' and reduction   in affordable housing.
Unedifying arm-twisting.

Will be a precedent, contrary to report's assertion (22,23,24)

## All in it together?

While Southwark would the first option of buying the affordable housing under the MIP clause, at the market rate for affordabe hosuing, it would also have to meet the amount due and outstanding under the terms under the relevant security documentation including the all accrued principal monies, interests and costs and expenses. The report, inevitably, cites the Covid crisis twice, on one occasion to bolster Peabody, by saying how difficult it is to get bank finance, on the other to say that bowing to the MIP clause demand will help affordable housing delivery 'as we emerge from the Covid-crisis'.  Peabody and Berkely draw no criticism for making the demand that threatens delivery in the first place.

## Open for business

When Southwark's chief executive said the borough was open for business she was not kidding. Elephant..Lendlease...Delancey...viability assessments.  Covidcrisis...unviable developments down OKRd...expect more of this.  Malt St clear instance of passing the risk on.  Affordable housing is treated like an asset and a greater sum can be raised to clear any debt by selling affordable homes at free market values....(whereas before it was protected (check 'standard' MIP clause).

It would be easy for the planning committee to approve the clause in the almost sure knowledge that it will never be triggered and the affordable housing will always remain such.  But this is the thin end of a very long wedge.  These clauses have already been used in Islington, Tower Hamlets and Lamnbeth.  They are being actively promoted by the GLA.  Once they proliferate the whole principle of affordable housing being for 'in perpetuity' will start to be lost and developers and their registered provider partners will use the same kind of ingenuity that thye have used with viability assessments to squeeze real affordable housing out of London.


## What we think - profits first, people second

So at the bottom of all this is the Mayor's desire to appease developers and RPs, who in turn want to appease the banks.  An s106 arrangement that has worked perfectly well up to now (banks have evidently been satisfied with the standard MIP clause, it has never been triggered, and no RP as ever gone bust) is to be changed, compromising the 'in perpetuity' principle of affordable housing.  The Mayor hopes that this will increase the amount of 'affordable housing', but has extracted (published) no concrete commitment from developers/RPs in exchange for the more developer friendly MIP (true?; it may make affordable housing a more 'liquid' asset, but that its no guarantee we will get more affordable housing, in th longer run.  The Mayor is a long way of meeting his 50% strategic affordable housing target (check AMR) and has shown how elastic his interpretation of what developers have to do to meet affordable houisng policies is, in the case of the Biscuit Factory.

Check Peabody, Berkeley home delivery record.
Also worth noting 

Southwark's planning committee should reject this proposal, which purports to facilitate a general increase in affordable housing, but presents no evidence that this will actually happen either in Southwark or elswhere.  There is no guarantee that any finacial gain from making affordable housing more 'liquid' (reduced borrowing costs, bigger loans) will not simply be syphoned off as bigger profits.  The change though will definitely compromise the status of affordable housing having to remain so 'in perpetuity' - the thin end of a very long wedge.

The report (link), goes to planning committee on Monday 4 May, the first to be held online.
