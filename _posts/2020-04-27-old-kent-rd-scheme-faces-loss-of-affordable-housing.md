## Berkely Homes threatens to reduce affordable housing at Malt St

Berkely Homes (link) has the honour of being the first developer in Southwark to take advantage of the Coronavirus crisis.  It secured planning permission for the Malt St development, just off the Old Kent Rd, in June 2019 (links), with a promise to build 40% affordable housing, but is now back with the threat that it will reduce the amount of affordable housing, unless Southwark agrees to an unprecedented clause in its planning agreement, that could see all the affordable housing lost, should its development development partner, Peabody (link), hit financial trouble.

Peabody got its own planning permission for the neighbouring Nyes Wharf redevelopment, in September 2018, but sold this on to Berkely, with Peabody to provide  all the affordable housing across both sites.  Together the two sites will deliver 1,569 new homes of which 581 will be affordable (359 at social rent and 222 shared-ownership).

Now Southwark's planning committee has been asked 

When Southwark's chief executive said the borough was open for business she was not kidding. Elephant..Lendlease...Delancey...viability assessments.  Covidcrisis...unviable developments down OKRd...expect more of this.  Malt St clear instance of passing the risk on.  Affordable housing is treated like an asset and a greater sum can be raised to clear any debt by selling affordable homes at free market values....(whereas before it was protected (check 'standard' MIP clause).
