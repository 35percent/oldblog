## Berkely Homes threatens to reduce affordable housing at Malt St

Berkely Homes (link) has the honour of being the first developer in Southwark to threaten to reduce the affordable housing in one its developments, since the onset of the Coronavirus crisis.  Berkely secured planning permission for the Malt St development, just off the Old Kent Rd, in June 2019 (links), with a promise to build 40% affordable housing, but now a planning committee report reveals that Berkeley intends to appeal agianst that it will reduce the amount of affordable housing, unless Southwark agrees to an unprecedented clause in its planning agreement, that could see all the affordable housing lost, should its development development partner, Peabody (link), hit financial trouble.

Peabody got its own planning permission for the neighbouring Nyes Wharf redevelopment, in September 2018, but sold this on to Berkely, with Peabody to provide  all the affordable housing across both sites.  Together the two sites will deliver 1,569 new homes of which 581 will be affordable (359 at social rent and 222 shared-ownership).

Now Southwark's planning committee has been asked to approve a so-called Mortgagee in Possession (MIP) clause in the s106 planning agreement with Southwark that would enable Peabody, or its creditors, to sell-off all the affordable housing onto the open market, under certain circumstances.  The proposal is made in a report (link), going to planning committee on Monday 4 May, the first to be held online.

The MIP report is at pains to point out that such a sale is very unlikely to happen, because Peabody is in rude financial health; it has an annual turnover of £630m, an annual profit of £160m and assets of £7.6bn, so the possibility that it will fail is remote.  The report reinforces the point by noting that no major housing association has ever gone into administration and quotes a GLA document that says 'there is no known cases of a MIP clause being triggered.....'.

This all begs the obvious question - why have this new clause if it is never going to be needed?
A careful reading of th report gives an answer. While the Malt St scheme is 'enitirely financed by Peabody from its own investment

Unedifying arm-twisting.


## Open for business

When Southwark's chief executive said the borough was open for business she was not kidding. Elephant..Lendlease...Delancey...viability assessments.  Covidcrisis...unviable developments down OKRd...expect more of this.  Malt St clear instance of passing the risk on.  Affordable housing is treated like an asset and a greater sum can be raised to clear any debt by selling affordable homes at free market values....(whereas before it was protected (check 'standard' MIP clause).

It would be easy for the planning committee to approve the clause in the almost sure knowledge that it will never be triggered and the affordable housing will always remain such.  But this is the thin end of a very long wedge.  These clauses have already been used in Islington, Tower Hamlets and Lamnbeth.  They are being actively promoted by the GLA.  Once they proliferate the whole principle of affordable housing being for 'in perpetuity' will start to be lost and developers and their registered provider partners will use the same kind of ingenuity that thye have used with viability assessments to squeeze real affordable housing out of London.



## All in it together?

While Southwark would the first option of buying the affordable housing under the MIP clause, at the market rate for affordabe hosuing, it would also have to meet the amount due and outstanding under the terms under the relevant security documentation including the all accrued principal monies, interests and costs and expenses. The rport cites the Covid crisis twice, on each occasion to bol
