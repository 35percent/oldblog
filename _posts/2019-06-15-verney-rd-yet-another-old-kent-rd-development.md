## Third large application in a month goes to committee

The application for a mixed-use development at 6-12 Verney Rd, just off the Old Kent Rd, behind PC World, is due to be considered by Southwark's [planning committee this Monday](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=119&MId=6392&Ver=4) (18 June).  The proposal is for 3 tall blocks, the tallest of 17 storeys, compising 338 residential units, office and workspace and associated open, green and amenity spaces. The application is [recommended for approval](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s83243/Report%20and%20Appendix%201%20and%202%206%20-%2012%20Verney%20Road%20London%20SE16%203DH.pdf).

The application follows [Malt St](http://35percent.org/2019-06-01-malt-street-berkeley-homes-old-kent-road/), [Southernwood Retail Park](http://35percent.org/2019-05-27-southernwood-retail-park/), [Cantium Retail Park](https://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/9869) and [Ruby Triangle](http://35percent.org/2018-10-08-ruby-triangle-goes-to-committee/) and is the latest of the big developments being rushed through planning committee, in advance of the adoption of the [Old Kent Rd Area Action Plan (AAAP](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning-policy-and-transport-policy/development-plan/area-action-plans?chapter=2).
