title: Verney Rd - yet another Old Kent Rd development
---
## Third large application in a month goes to committee

The application for a mixed-use development at 6-12 Verney Rd, just off the Old Kent Rd, behind PC World, is due to be considered by Southwark's [planning committee this Monday](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=119&MId=6392&Ver=4) (18 June).  The proposal is for 3 tall blocks, the tallest of 17 storeys, compising 338 residential units, office and workspace and associated open, green and amenity spaces. The application is [recommended for approval](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s83243/Report%20and%20Appendix%201%20and%202%206%20-%2012%20Verney%20Road%20London%20SE16%203DH.pdf).

The application follows [Malt St](http://35percent.org/2019-06-01-malt-street-berkeley-homes-old-kent-road/), approved less than two weeks ago, [Southernwood Retail Park](http://35percent.org/2019-05-27-southernwood-retail-park/), [Cantium Retail Park](https://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/9869) and [Ruby Triangle](http://35percent.org/2018-10-08-ruby-triangle-goes-to-committee/) and is the latest of the big developments being rushed through planning committee, in advance of the adoption of the [Old Kent Rd Area Action Plan (AAAP](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning-policy-and-transport-policy/development-plan/area-action-plans?chapter=2).

While a somewhat smaller Verney Rd shares several characteristics with the other Old Kent Rd developments. All have local plan compliant 35% affordable housing, in an aproximate 70:30 social rent:intermediate housing split (Ruby Triangle and Malt St have 40% affordable housing).  All, though, without exception, are technically non-viable, according to their viability assessments, so are unable in theory to meet this affordable housing requirement.  This is reducing the consideration of the real viability of these schemes to something of a ritual; Verney Rd is a good example - the developer [CB Acquisition London Ltd](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!L5kRr99Gvx64nCZlTK8JqQ%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d),
([correpondance address, Cayman Islands](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/officers/NHZ7WPE191E-dhaeASgbVK9QiZk/appointmentsclaims)) say that the scheme will only make about [half the profit](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!TQY%2bsILnV9wsUjV9l44bPw%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) needed to support the affordable housing required and the [Council's appraiser broadly agrees](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s83243/Report%20and%20Appendix%201%20and%202%206%20-%2012%20Verney%20Road%20London%20SE16%203DH.pdf), with some caveats, but then, after 'stand-back analysis' or 'sensitivity testing', the developer graciously agrees to deliver the affordable housing regardless.

This is different to what has been happening at the Elephant and Castle, where every major development used viability to [refuse to deliver](http://35percent.org/major-schemes/) policy compliant affordable housing, so must count as progress, but maybe not as much progress as it first appears.  Verney Rd is a Strategic Industrial Location, which means it should deliver 50% affordable housing, if that industrial land is lost, according the Mayor's [draft New London Plan](ttps://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/draft_london_plan_-showing_minor_suggested_changes_july_2018.pdf).  This was also the case for Ruby Triangle and Malt St.  The draft NLP is not yet adopted, so developers are getting in quick before it takes full force.  Second, while CB Acquisition Ltd are offering 35% affordable housing, they want any improvement in viability to _'be used to bridge the current viability "gap" rather than for further planning obligations'_ (ie affordable housing).  This pre-empts the use of a late review mechanism, designed to capture any uplift in profits for affordable housing when the development is complete.
