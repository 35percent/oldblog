title: Verney Rd - yet another Old Kent Rd development
---
## Third large application in a month goes to committee

The application for a mixed-use development at 6-12 Verney Rd, just off the Old Kent Rd, behind PC World, is due to be considered by Southwark's [planning committee this Monday](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=119&MId=6392&Ver=4) (18 June).  The proposal is for 3 tall blocks, the tallest of 17 storeys, compising 338 residential units, office and workspace and associated open, green and amenity spaces. The application is [recommended for approval](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s83243/Report%20and%20Appendix%201%20and%202%206%20-%2012%20Verney%20Road%20London%20SE16%203DH.pdf).

The application follows [Malt St](http://35percent.org/2019-06-01-malt-street-berkeley-homes-old-kent-road/), approved less than two weeks ago, [Southernwood Retail Park](http://35percent.org/2019-05-27-southernwood-retail-park/), [Cantium Retail Park](https://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/9869) and [Ruby Triangle](http://35percent.org/2018-10-08-ruby-triangle-goes-to-committee/) and is the latest of the big developments being rushed through planning committee, in advance of the adoption of the [Old Kent Rd Area Action Plan (AAAP](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning-policy-and-transport-policy/development-plan/area-action-plans?chapter=2).

While a somewhat smaller Verney Rd shares several characteristics with the other Old Kent Rd developments. All have 35% affordable housing, in an aproximate 70:30 social rent:intermediate housing split, compliant with the local plan Ruby Triangle and Malt St have 40% affordable housing).  All, though, without exception, are technically non-viable, according to their viability assessments, so should be unable, in theory, to meet this affordable housing requirement.  

This contradiction is reducing the consideration of viability into something of a ritual of which Verney Rd is a good example; the developer [CB Acquisition London Ltd](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!L5kRr99Gvx64nCZlTK8JqQ%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d),
([correpondance address, Cayman Islands](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/officers/NHZ7WPE191E-dhaeASgbVK9QiZk/appointmentsclaims)) say that the scheme will only make about [half the profit](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!TQY%2bsILnV9wsUjV9l44bPw%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) needed to support the affordable housing required and the [Council's appraiser broadly agrees](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s83243/Report%20and%20Appendix%201%20and%202%206%20-%2012%20Verney%20Road%20London%20SE16%203DH.pdf), with some caveats, but then, after 'stand-back analysis' or 'sensitivity testing' (and with the Bakerloo Line Extension (BLE) very much in mind) the developer graciously agrees to deliver the affordable housing regardless.

This is different to what has been happening at the Elephant and Castle, where every major development used viability to [refuse to deliver](http://35percent.org/major-schemes/) policy compliant affordable housing, so must count as progress, but maybe not as much progress as it first appears.  Verney Rd is a Strategic Industrial Location, which means it should deliver 50% affordable housing, if that industrial land is lost, according the Mayor's [draft New London Plan](ttps://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/draft_london_plan_-showing_minor_suggested_changes_july_2018.pdf).  This was also the case for Ruby Triangle and Malt St.  The draft NLP is not yet adopted, so developers are getting in quick before it takes full force.  Second, while CB Acquisition Ltd are offering 35% affordable housing, they want any improvement in viability to _'be used to bridge the current viability "gap" rather than for further planning obligations'_ (ie affordable housing).  This pre-empts the use of a late review mechanism, designed to capture any uplift in profits for affordable housing when the development is complete.  (Malt St was passed without a late stage review mechanism, though both Ruby Triangle and Cantium Retail Park have them). 

On top of this Verney Rd is a very dense development - 1180 habitable rooms per hectare - way above the policy range of 200-700 habitable roomes per hectare (hrh) for an Urban Density Zone, which is now a dead letter. But even Verney Rd is not as dense as Ruby Triangle (2713 hrh) and Cantium and Southernwood Retail Parks (2353 hrh and 2522 hrh respectively).  Together they will deliver over 4,600 homes, with a gross development value above Â£2bn, meaning marginal improvements in the figures can have a big impact on profitability.

All the Old Kent Rd deevlopers show a marked reluctance to take advantage of the grant funding available from the Mayor - only Ruby Triangle and Malt St have done so and then only for 5% of the affordable housing.  As Malt St developer, Berkeley Homes explains it, the level of grant per unit is not sufficient to compensate for the money that can be made from keeping homes free-market. 

So, the picture that emerges is that of a pact being struck - developers will deliver the affordable housing that the local plan requires, but not much more, regardless of the true profitability of the developments and of any 'stratigic' target of 50% affordable housing, set by the Mayor.  On the other hand, should, say problems occur with the BLE, reducing the prices that can be charged for new homs, it is not hard to envisage developers returning to Southwark, reminding them that they always said their schemes were technically unviable,and looking for a reduction in the affordable housing. 

This is being done in advance of the adoption of the Old Kent Rd AAP
