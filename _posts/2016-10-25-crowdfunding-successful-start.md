## Aylesbury Crowdfunding success
Our [crowdfunding 
campaign](https://www.gofundme.com/aylesbury-the-right-to-a-community-2uefgf2s) 
to help Aylesbury leaseholders resist Southwark's attempt to overturn [their 
CPO victory]
(http://35percent.org/2016-09-18-aylesbury-compulsory-purchase-order-rejected/)
has got off to a great start. We have raised over £2000 
in the first week, a testament to the support the leaseholders enjoy.  Many 
thanks to everyone who has donated so far - our target is £7000; we aim to get 
the leaseholders
representation throughout the legal proceedings.

In the meantime the leaseholders' barrister has started work on the case and on 
submitting a preliminary responses to the Council's [letter before 
claim](http://35percent.org/img/20161007_Secretary_of_State_Aylesbury_CPO.pdf). 

On Monday the Secretary of State issued his own [detailed 
response](/img/SoSresponsetoLbC.pdf) to Southwark's 'letter before claim'.  It 
says that Southwark's grounds of appeal have 'no merit' and are all 
'unarguable' and that the SoS will 'robustly defend' its CPO decision and 'seek 
his costs of doing so'.

Meanwhile, Southwark continues to justify its appeal by claiming that the CPO 
decision is preventing it from continuing with the regeneration of the estate 
which will deliver at least 1,260 new 'affordable' homes. As we have 
[repeatedly pointed 
out](http://35percent.org/2016-09-26-council-appeals-aylesbury-cpo-decision/),
however, the scheme will still result in a net loss of at least 778 social 
rented homes, so we count any decision that goes towards preventing this as a 
good one.

Southwark has made much of the fact that the Aylesbury estate is being redeveloped 
by a Notting Hill Housing Trust, a 'non-profit' housing association. It says much less 
about Notting Hill's 'developer partner' for the scheme, Barratt Homes.  Barratt is the UK's 
largest private developer and will be both building and selling all of the 
redeveloped estate's 1773 private market homes, with [expected profit of 
£163.8m.](http://35percent.org/2016-09-26-council-appeals-aylesbury-cpo-decision/)

Barratt was in the news last week, when its top London executive was 
[arrested](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/19/barratt-executive-arrested-internal-inquiry-alastair-baird) 
on suspicion of bribery, following an investigation into the awarding of 
contracts.  Barrett are
bulders in the Canada Water regeneration and Mr Baird was present at the 
[topping-out ceremony for
the new 
library](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/news/article/146/new_iconic_southwark_building_emerges).
More unhappily he also appeared alongside Notting Hill Housing at an [angry 
public meeting]
(http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/residents-anger-set-to-force-sub-let-u-turn/6504705.article) 
on the Bedfont Lakes estate in Feltham, to answer for serious flaws in the 
estate's gas boiler
system.
