Our [crowdfunding 
campaign](https://www.gofundme.com/aylesbury-the-right-to-a-community-2uefgf2s) 
to help Aylesbury leaseholders resist Southwark's 
[attempt](http://35percent.org/2016-09-26-council-appeals-aylesbury-cpo-decision/) 
to overturn [their CPO 
victory](http://35percent.org/2016-09-18-aylesbury-compulsory-purchase-order-rejected/)
has got off to a great start. We have raised over £2000 in the first week, a testament to the support the leaseholders enjoy. Many thanks to everyone who has donated so far - our target is £7000; we aim to get the leaseholders representation throughout the legal proceedings.

In the meantime the leaseholders' barrister has started work on the case and on 
submitting a preliminary response to the Council's [letter before 
claim](http://35percent.org/img/20161007_Secretary_of_State_Aylesbury_CPO.pdf). 

On Monday the Secretary of State issued his own [detailed 
response](/img/SoSresponsetoLbC.pdf) to Southwark's 'letter before claim'. It 
says that Southwark's grounds of appeal have 'no merit', are all 'unarguable' 
and that the SoS will 'robustly defend' its CPO decision and 'seek his costs of 
doing so'.

Meanwhile, Southwark continues to justify its appeal by claiming that the CPO decision is preventing it from continuing with the regeneration of the estate which will deliver at least 1,260 new 'affordable' homes. As we have [repeatedly pointed out](http://35percent.org/2016-09-26-council-appeals-aylesbury-cpo-decision/), however, the scheme will still result in a net loss of at least 778 social rented homes, so we count any decision that goes towards preventing this as a good one.

## Development partner in the dock
Southwark has made much of the fact that the Aylesbury estate is being 
redeveloped by Notting Hill Housing Trust, a 'non-profit' housing association.  
It says much less about Notting Hill's 'developer partner' for the scheme, 
Barratt Homes. Barratt is the UK's largest private developer and will be both 
building and selling all of the redeveloped estate's 1773 private market homes, 
with an [expected gross worth of £768m.](http://35percent.org/img/document.pdf) 

Barratt was in the news last week, when its chief London executive Alastair 
Baird, was 
[arrested](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/19/barratt-executive-arrested-internal-inquiry-alastair-baird) 
on suspicion of bribery, following an investigation into the awarding of 
contracts. Barratt has a large number of [developments in 
Southwark](http://35percent.org/2015-09-14-barratt-conquers-southwark/) and was 
contracted to build the [replacement](http://35percent.org/auctions#libraries) 
Canada Water library.  Here Mr Baird can be seen alongside Council chiefs at 
the [topping-out ceremony for
the new library](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/news/article/146/new_iconic_southwark_building_emerges).

More unhappily he also appeared alongside Notting Hill Housing at an [angry 
public 
meeting](http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/residents-anger-set-to-force-sub-let-u-turn/6504705.article) 
on the Bedfont Lakes estate in Feltham, to answer for serious flaws in the 
estate's gas boiler system.

In coming blogs we'll be taking a closer look at Notting Hill Housing Trust's deal with Barratt, Notting Hill's wider role in the [Aylesbury redevelopment partnership](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/aylesbury_estate_development_par#outgoing-591461) and the growing [disquiet](https://twitter.com/coyleneil/status/787588742366232576) 
about [Notting Hill's conduct](http://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/housing-association-slammed-nightmare-scenario-eviction-threat-bermondseys-st-james-estate/) elsewhere in the borough.
