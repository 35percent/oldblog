## Delancey blank Sadiq Khan's demand for a 'robust' shopping centre trader relocation strategy

Elephant shopping centre owner and developer Delancey have presented Sadiq Khan with a blank piece of paper in response to his demand for a ['robust relocation strategy'](https://www.change.org/p/sadiq-khan-sadiq-say-no-to-the-displacement-of-bame-communities-from-elephant-castle/responses/41627) for traders displaced by the centre's proposed demolition and redevelopment.

The snub comes in the [legal S106 agreement](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!cmd1tKmi8kCHCJ6ouDat0w%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) that seals the planning permission resolved by Southwark Council in July, for the centre's demolition and redevelopment.  The relocation strategy should have been inclued in the draft S106 sent to the Mayor last week, but the relevant appendix, Appendix 12, is blank (and mis-titled as 'Castle Square Site Plan) (screen-shot).  The bare-bones of a strategy are given elsewhere (Part 6 of Schedule 2), including plans for a database of relocation oppoortunites, proposals for a Â£634,700 relocation fund and a temporary relocation space, but nothing that amounts to a fully-fleshed out strategy.

The S106 also claims that the Trader Panel has been established and its membership has been approved by the Council, when there are no traders yet confirmed as members.  

The S106 notes that Delancey has agreed to provide temporary retail provision in the shape of Castle Square.  While a clear gain for traders and campaigners, Castle Square is nowhere near big enough for all the traders who need accommodating.  The application has received over a [hundred objections](http://35percent.org/boxpark/#object) on this and other issues and is due to be decided by Southwark's planning sub-committee B on [12 December](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=353&MId=6147&Ver=4).

Other notable aspects of the S106 agreement

No mention of increasing the social housing offer above the 116 units Delancey have already committed to build, in the event of Delancey recieving a GLA grant.  Delancey has stated it will apply for this (check)and the planning committee was given the very clear impression that a bid would be a guaranteed success.

Several points on which Southwark and Delancey arre not in agreement, including the target profit on the residential element of the scheme - Dleancey want 17.5%, Southwark 12%.  This could be significant, if the target is exceeded, when have the extra profit should go to Southwark and more affordable housing.

Mayor Sadiq Khan has until 13 December to decide whether to allow the scheme to be approved. He can direct that the application be refused or take over the application in order to determine the case himself.  He has said he will also be subjecting the affordable housing offer to 'rigourous scrutiny' and addressing unresolved transport issues.

It's hard to see how what Delancey has submitted qualifies as 'robust'.  Above all else the traders have not had the opportunity to properly discuss Delancey's proposals, yet alone amend or improve them.  Delancey has held just one open meeting with traders, with a second scheduled for 13 December, just about the time the Mayor has to make his decision on the application.

There is also several unanswered questions over any GLA funding for social rented housing - have Delancey made an application for this?  Will they get it? Will it increase the amount of social rented housing or just subsidise the 116 units Delancey have already committed to building?

The Mayor also needs to have a close look at the ridiculously complex arrangements for extending the London Livng Rent and other so-called affordable, discounted market rent tenacies, beyond their 3-year terms.  Tenants who are fortunate enough to see their salary increase may also find much of it going to Delancey, if they jump into a higher band of rent payment - or maybe not, depending on what other affordable units are available at the time.  Final decisions are left in the hands of Delancey, or its agents, 'to consider' (check).

The case for Sadiq Khan 'calling-in'this decision is strong and we urge him to do so, for the sake of  shopping Centre traders, the local community and all future residents.
