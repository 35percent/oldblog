## Delancey blank Sadiq Khan's demand for a 'robust' shopping centre trader relocation strategy

Elephant shopping centre owner and developer Delancey have presented Sadiq Khan with a blank piece of paper in response to his demand for a ['robust relocation strategy'](https://www.change.org/p/sadiq-khan-sadiq-say-no-to-the-displacement-of-bame-communities-from-elephant-castle/responses/41627) for traders displaced by the centre's proposed demolition and redevelopment.

The snub comes in the legal S106 agreement that seals the planning permission resolved by Southwark Council in july, for the centre's demolition and redevelopment.  The relocation strategy should have been inclued in the draft S106 sent to the Mayor last week, but the relevant appendix, Appendix 12, is blank (and mis-titled as 'Castle Square Site Plan) (screen-shot).  The bare-bones of a strategy are given elsewhere, Part 6 of Schedule 2, including plans for a database of relocation oppoortunites, proposals for a Â£634,700 relocation fund and a temporary relocation space, but nothing that amounts to a fully-fleshed out strategy.

The S106 also claims that the Trader Panel has been established and its membership has been approved by the Council, when there are no traders are as yet confirmed as members.  A meeting of traders with Delancey is scheduled for 12 December.

Mayor Sadiq Khan has until 13 December to decide whether to allow the scheme to be approved. He can direct that the application be refused or take over the application in order to determine the case himself.  He has said he will also be subjecting the affordable housing offer to 'rigourous scrutiny' and addressing unresolved transport issues.
