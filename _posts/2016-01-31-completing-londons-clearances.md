David Cameron's [announcement](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/prime-minister-pledges-to-transform-sink-estates) that the government will be regenerating 100 council estates across the country, should send a chill down the spine of every council tenant and leaseholder in the country.

This, combined with the Housing & Planning Bill that's being railroaded through parliament, has been interpreted by many as the end of social housing. It is hard to disagree.

Here in Southwark, we know how these estate regenerations - full of [promises](/affordable-housing/) of replacement 'social' housing and [rights to return](/2013-06-08-the-heygate-diaspora/) - usually end up. The Heygate is the most notorious example, but it is just one of many:

That's a net loss of 4,275 social rented homes as a direct result of Southwark's regeneration schemes to date and the [GLA has predicted](https://www.london.gov.uk/press-releases/assembly/darren-johnson/loss-of-social-housing-through-estate-regeneration) that Southwark will lose 2,051 social rented homes as a result of schemes in its current pipeline (far more than any other borough). In addition, we can't even be sure that the replacement social rented housing provided isn't actually affordable rent or won't morph into it - see the [CPO Public Inquiry](https://youtu.be/x0CIUdfA-JU?t=4m12s), our [corporate complaint](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/Corporate_Complaint_15_Dec_2015Final.pdf), [full list of tenure breaches](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/section106_tenure_breaches.pdf) and [local news article](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/SN_affordablerent.pdf) for evidence of this.

## Southwark's estate regeneration pipeline
Despite widespread criticism, Southwark is [ploughing ahead](/2015-03-28-manifesto-for-destruction-of-council-estates/) with further regeneration plans, largely informed by a Savills ['Asset Performance Evaluation'](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s55626/Appendix%204%20Savills%20Evaluation.pdf) undertaken last year (the assets being our council homes).


Savills's evaluation informed the Council's [2016 Housing Asset Management Strategy](https://consultations.southwark.gov.uk/housing-community-services-department-community-engagement-team/asset-management-consultation/supporting_documents/Asset%20Management%20Strategy.pdf), which established that _"11.5% of the stock (4,167 units) has a Net Present Value which is below zero"_ located on what it terms _'High Investment Needs Estates'_[^1] - for which it is recommended that _"options be explored with residents as to whether a small scale redevelopment or regeneration scheme may deliver better outcomes than direct refurbishment."_[^2]

The report goes on to explain the _"key potential options for identified poorly performing stock"_:

![](http://35percent.org/img/savills2.png)

It also explores a number of additional strategies to achieve the desired _"improvement in business plan capacity"_. These include increasing rents, albeit _"subject to the Council's policies on rents .. and plans to explored devolved management."_ A practice which we argue is already being introduced via the backdoor[^3].

![](http://35percent.org/img/savills1.png)

The publication of the report understandably created [concerns](http://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/your-home-is-worth-less-than-nothing-council-report-evaluates-southwark-properties/) amongst tenants living on the _"poorly performing"_ estates. In response to these, the Council's Housing Boss [explained](http://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/no-more-wholesale-estate-demolition-says-housing-boss/) that demolition will be considered on a “case by case basis” and that _“In a small number of cases it may mean demolition but in the vast majority of cases it certainly won’t.”_


## Savills and Southwark
<img src="/img/socialcleanserssavills.jpg" align="left" style="margin:10px" width="170">We [blogged](/2015-12-20-heygate-sell-off-how-much-are-we-getting/) about this in December and noted that Savills is just as happy [selling off](/auctions) Southwark's high-value assets, as it is identifying those low-value assets that could be candidates for demolition. Savills also prepared the notorious [viability assessment](http://crappistmartin.github.io/collated-viability-assessments/) that [allowed](/2015-06-25-heygate-viability-assessment-finally-revealed/) Lendlease to slash the social rented housing on [Elephant Park](http://www.elephantpark.co.uk) (the New Heygate) to just 82 social rented units. 

![](http://35percent.org/img/savills.png)

So it comes as no surprise to learn that Savills are the brains behind David Cameron's big idea of 'regenerating' 100 council estates, supplied by its Cabinet Office report ['Completing London's Streets'](http://www.savills.co.uk/research_articles/141285/198087-0). The report happens to feature a photo of a Southwark estate, the Brandon, to illustrate how the estate's generous green spaces constitute a _"housing typography"_ that is _"deeply inappropriate for current and coming decades"_.   

![](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/completing-londons-streets-brandon.png)

The report also uses the Nelson/Portland estate on East Street in Walworth as one of 6 case study sites to expound its ideas (Site C). Two other estates identified by the 35% Campaign are the Glyndon estate in Woolwich (Site B) and the Ampthill Square estate in Camden (Site A). The estates are not easily identified in the report, they are not named and have been disguised by flipping and rotating their layout plans.

![](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/completing-londons-streets.png)

Below Savills explains that their case study estates _"do not represent any current, existing or proposed scheme"_, so the residents of Nelson/Portland, Glyndon and Ampthill Square estates can rest easy in their beds...

## There is an alternative
If local communities are to be protected then regeneration has to mean something other than state-sponsored gentrification championed by the property services industry, which makes great profit from it in every which way. 

[Refurbishment](http://www.engineering.ucl.ac.uk/engineering-exchange/demolition-refurbishment-social-housing/) needs to be considered. And if building new council homes [is costing £383k](http://www.estatesgazette.com/blogs/london-residential-research/2015/07/costs-southwark-council-528149-build-council-flat/) each, when homes on _'high investment needs estates'_ can be brought up to Decent Homes Standard for a fraction of this, then there is no reason not to do that.

## Latest GLA housing figures
The [London Tenants Federation](http://www.londontenants.org/) has published its [analysis](/img/LTF_delivery_of_housing_in_London_2014-15.pdf) of the latest [GLA housing data](http://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/gla-affordable-housing-programme-outturn/resource/0ff48fbb-5119-4af1-9692-d0fa57093371) published for 2014/15. The analysis found that:

* Southwark delivered 1,965 homes in 2014/15.

* It delivered only 51 (net) affordable homes (3% of the homes delivered in the borough).

* It demolished more social rented homes than it built – losing 170 social rented homes in total and delivered 75 affordable rent homes (a combined total of -95).
