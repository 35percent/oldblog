## Infrastructure Tariff
Page 75 of the AAAP describes infrastructure funding. It says the developer will pay an ‘infrastructure tariff’, which will fund new public infrastructure facilities on the redeveloped estate.
The AAAP Background Paper ‘Infrastructure Tariff and S106 Contributions’ (RL4) section 8.2 sets out a formula for calculating the level of the tariff:

“Tariff = (Cost of Infrastructure / No. of residential units) – Grant”
It said that at the current level of the Tariff “currently equates to an average of £13,420 per unit at today’s prices.” 
If applied to the 842 units proposed for the FDS scheme, this would amount to a required tariff payment of £11.3m to the Council by NHHT.

Paragraphs 7.8 and 7.9 of the Acquiring Authority’s November 2017 updated statement of case claims that the infrastructure tariff has been ‘superseded’ by the agreement with NHHT, in which it is to deliver the public infrastructure directly rather than through a tariff.
This may be read to infer that NHHT is paying for the infrastructure, but this is not the case; it is the Acquiring Authority footing the bill for much of the key infrastructure.
This is confirmed in paragraph 8.15 of the Acquiring Authority’s Nov 2017 statement of case, which says that the £32.4m required to pay for the construction of the key infrastructure facilities (community/health facilities and new library) at plot 18, is being funded directly from the Council’s Capital Programme.
Whilst NHHT is obliged by the terms of the DPA to pay the Council a £9m towards this plot 18 infrastructure, the unredacted provisions of the DPA (See George Turner’s appendix) shows that this £9m contribution can be deducted from the fixed land payments that NHHT is supposed to pay the Council for the land.

Netting off the contribution against the Council’s payment for the land means that it is effectively paying the entire £32m cost of providing the plot 18 public infrastructure. 




## Background
By way of background, the main objectors to the compulsory purchase order are four remaining leaseholders on the first main phase of the Aylesbury estate redevelopment.

They are all from BAME groups, primarily Black African and Carribean and are the last remaining residents on the empty site.

They Council first applied for a compulsory purchase order to gain vacant possession from them in 2014. This went to a [public inquiry in 2015](http://35percent.org/2015-05-02-aylesbury-estate-compulsory-purchase-order-public-inquiry/) and the CPO was subsequently [rejected by the Secretary of State](http://35percent.org/2016-09-18-aylesbury-compulsory-purchase-order-rejected/) on the grounds that the leaseholders would end up either displaced by the scheme or impoverished if they took up one of the shared ownership rehousing options offered by the Council's development partner. Listing his reasons for refusal, the Secretary of State's [decision notice](http://35percent.org/img/Decision_Letter_Final.pdf) said that this would be a breach of the Equalities Act.

The Council subsequently [appealed](http://35percent.org/2016-10-17-aylesbury-cpo-legal-challenge-scrutinised/) the Secretary of State's decision. The Council's appeal was based not on the unreasonableness of the Secretary of State's decision but the wording of the decision notice.

Instead of fighting the appeal, the Secretary of State offered the compromise of re-hearing the inquiry and this is where we are now. 

There has been lost of interest in the Aylesbury CPO. It has been subject of much discussion in the legal world and heralded as a test case - right to a community etc.

The Council [claims] that the maintenance costs are too high but it hasn't done ANY cost/benefit analysis.

Proof that this regeneration is being pushed through by ideologues.

## Refurbishment
We take a pragmatic and common sense approach. The buildings have been declared structurally sound and architects and a quantity surveyor will present an alternative plan showing how refurbishment is
