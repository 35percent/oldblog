Last week was the deadline for the exchange of witness evidence for the forthcoming Aylesbury estate CPO public inquiry, which commences on 9th January and is Southwark's latest in a series of failed attempts to remove the estate's leaseholders from their homes.

The inquiry will be a re-hearing of the [2015 public inquiry](http://35percent.org/2015-05-02-aylesbury-estate-compulsory-purchase-order-public-inquiry/) in which the Secretary of State [ruled](http://35percent.org/2016-09-18-aylesbury-compulsory-purchase-order-rejected/) that the Council had breached human and equalities rights, in a [landmark decision](http://hsfnotes.com/realestatedevelopment/2016/09/28/a-new-right-to-a-community-decision-by-the-secretary-of-state-not-to-confirm-the-cpo-for-aylesbury-estate/).

Southwark then [appealed](http://35percent.org/2016-09-26-council-appeals-aylesbury-cpo-decision/) this ruling in the High Court and succeeded in overturning it on a technicality. 

This second inquiry will now hear the case afresh, which in the meantime has become a [hot topic](https://www.ashurst.com/en/news-and-insights/legal-updates/compulsory-purchase-life-after-aylesbury/) in legal and planning circles.

As an interested party to the proceedings, we have been helping Aylesbury leaseholders organise and submit their witness evidence, which can be viewed on their website here: [http://ouraylesbury.org/cpo](http://ouraylesbury.org/cpo)

The evidence - presented by a number of expert witnesses - covers a number of areas showing how the Aylesbury scheme fails to satisfy the well-being test required under cpo legislation[^1]:

## Resident satisfaction
Three astonishing results in the "Living on the Aylesbury Estate" document:
p19 of the doc (which is appendix 4 (LL4) to Loretta's PoE):

Satisfied with local area as a place to live
89.0%   - response from Aylesbury
75.6%   - response from "comparable area"

Plan to remain a resident for a number of years
90.0%  - response from Aylesbury
51.2%  - response from "comparable area"

Belong to this neighbourhood
89.1%  - response from Aylesbury
60.8% - response from "comparable area"


## Like for like
First and foremost, the leaseholders themselves will give evidence showing how the CPO will impact on their well-being as a result of the Council's decision to renege on its original [promise of a like-for-like replacement](http://ouraylesbury.org) home.

They will be quoting [guidance](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/gla_migrate_files_destination/KnockItDownOrDoItUp_0.pdf) on estate regeneration from the London Assembly which says schemes must:

> "ensure that leaseholders are treated fairly and provide for them to nominate an independent valuer so they receive fair recompense for their properties. The starting point should be that leaseholders are offered a like-for-like replacement of their property, or a similar offer, wherever possible."

## Tenure mix/distribution
Professor Loretta Lees and Anna Minton will be giving evidence showing how the scheme has failed to comply with policy requirements on tenure mix. These require all blocks to include a pepper potted mix of private/affordable tenures, but in both the proposed scheme and the two completed phases, most of the blocks are mono tenure.

*Block D3 of first completed phase - entirely private housing*

They will also show evidence that of the 1489 Aylesbury estate residents decanted to date, only 112 have been rehoused in new homes on these two completed phases (7%).

## Affordable housing tenure
We will be giving evidence as well as a representative from London Tenants Federation, to the effect that the replacement 'social rented' housing will be affordable rent levels. We will show how Southwark's regeneration partner Notting Hill Housing [pulled this switch at the Bermondsey Spa regeneration](http://35percent.org/2015-03-18-stand-up-for-more-social-housing/) and show how this substitution has become [common practice](/redefining-social-rent) in Southwark.
 
## Design
Academics Ben Campkin and Richard Baxter will be giving evidence to counter Southwark's design criticisms and its justification for demolition

Professor Jane Rendell and quantity surveyor Simon Morrow will be showing designs for a costed refurbishment scheme which costs significantly less than demolition/rebuild and keeps the estate largely under Council ownership.

## Public subsidy, private profits - an unequal regeneration 'partnership'
Who pays, who benefits?
Southwark has paid the (ca. £10m) cost of buying out the leaseholders and is paying the £16.8m demolition costs for the buildings on the FDS plot. It will eventually receive a total of £17m from Notting Hill for the land, which (providing demolition costs don't exceed the estimate) will allow it to just about break even.

However, there is a clause 

## The case for demolition
Southwark says residents are in favour of demolition and that the scheme came about because of residents lobbying the Council to demolish their homes.

![](Extract from Wolverton SoC)

It claims that 82% of residents at the final exhibition supported the proposals - it didn't say that this was 82% of just 100 people - not all of which residents. Hardly a convincing mandate for an estate of 7000 people. 

Southwark claims in its evidence that residents are unsatisfied with their homes

## Help!
We still need funds!
Given the number of witnesses and amount of witness evidence submitted, the inquiry is likely to last for at least three weeks. We need more funds to ensure that the objectors can have full legal representation throughout the duration of the inquiry.
