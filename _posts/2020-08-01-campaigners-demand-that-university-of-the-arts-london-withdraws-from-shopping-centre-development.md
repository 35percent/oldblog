## Campaigners respond to UAL's Black Lives Matter statement

Campaigners fighting against the demolition and redevelopment of the Elephant and Castle have demanded that the University of the Arts London (UAL) withdraw from the controversial scheme.  The demand was made in an [open letter](https://southwarknotes.wordpress.com/2020/07/27/elephant-shopping-centre-university-of-the-arts-london-displaced-traders-and-black-lives-matter/) to the UAL's Rector, Sir Nigel Carrington.

UAL’s London College of Communication (LCC) is to benefit from [a new campus in the development](https://www.arts.ac.uk/about-ual/press-office/stories/new-ual-campus-at-the-heart-of-proposals-for-elephant-and-castle-town-centre-regeneration), after its current premises are demolished.  The shopping centre is due to be closed at the end of September 2020. UAL a key stakeholder, along with developer Delancey and a signatory of the s106 legal contract that underpins the development.

## Fifty traders with nowhere to go

Campaigners wrote to Sir Nigel Carrington in response to UAL’s publication of a [statement in respect of the Black Live Matter](https://www.arts.ac.uk/about-ual/press-office/stories/black-lives-matter) protests taking place across the world. In their statement, UAL declares _“We aim to build our anti-racism commitments through collective engagement into actions that make a meaningful difference.”_  The letter points out that many traders at the Shopping Centre have not been given any relocation space and they are all from black and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds. According to a Southwark Council report at least 28 of the displaced traders have not been offered relocation premises.  Local charity [Latin Elephant](https://latinelephant.org/) and [Petite Elephant](https://twitter.com/elephant_petit/status/1118825370017386496)  has conducted their own research which shows the figure is nearer 50 traders.

## Urgent action is needed now

The letter goes on to state _“Urgent action is now needed to rectify this distressing situation and it is within UAL’s power to effect this”_.  The letter says _“We are therefore asking UAL to withdraw from the redevelop_ment of the Elephant and Castle Shopping Centre if the organisation is genuinely committed to anti-racism.” 

The letter says _“UAL’s alleged commitment to anti-racism will not stand up to scrutiny if it allows the imminent erasure of this community in Elephant and Castle. In this case actions will prove to speak louder than words.”_ 

Campaigners acknowledge that the London College of Communication (LCC) is itself an important part of the Elephant and Castle, but while so many traders from BAME backgrounds have suffered under the redevelopment LCC is a big winner, gaining a new, state-of-the art campus.

The letter’s signatories are Planning Voice (Southwark Law Centre), Latin Elephant, Up the Elephant campaign, Anita Israel (#UALstillsowhite), Stand Up To Racism (Southwark), Southwark Notes.  The letter has copied to Natalie Brett (Pro Vice Chair UAL), Stafford Lancaster, (Investment Director, Delancey) Cllr Peter John OBE, (Leader, Southwark Council).

The letter was sent on the 17 July 2020, no reply had been received, at the date of this blog post.

## Southwark is also listening

Simultaneously with UAL, Southwark Council is conducting its own 'listening exercise', [Southwark Stands Together](https://consultations.southwark.gov.uk/housing-community-services-department-community-engagement-team/southwark-stands-together/?utm_content=&utm_medium=email&utm_name=&utm_source=govdelivery&utm_term=) asking anyone who lives, works or visits the borough about their experiences, so that they can _'identify solutions to address entrenched, persistent racism and injustice'_.

It seems to us that there can be no more blindingly obvious injustice than that shopping centre traders, many of [great longstanding and all from BAME backgrounds](http://35percent.org/2020-04-23-reality-for-traders-elephant-castle-shoppping-centre/) should face the loss of their their premises with no compensation and little prospect of continuing their businesses.
