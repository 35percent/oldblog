## A New Post
Delancey claims that its affordable housing offer is the maximum it can viably provide, but its [viability assessment](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!eW5y4yYs725p%2bJMli9Cf8g%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) contains several unexplained costs. Firstly there is a £79m unnamed construction cost on the East Site:

Secondly, there are two acquisition costs plus stamp duty amounting to £142m and a further £15m unitemised development cost included in Delancey's viability assessment (which was only made public at the end of last week):

Given that Delancey has owned the shopping centre since 2013 and is developing the land in partnership with the UAL which has owned its site for decades, we are at a loss as to explain what these acquisition costs represent and why they have been included as a cost to the scheme in Delancey's viability assessment.
