Instead of [blaming the Tories](https://twitter.com/karleastham/status/1062088721535787008) or mocking local campaign groups, we have come up with 10 constructive things that Southwark Council could to do in order to ease the effects of the housing crisis and create a fairer future for the borough's residents.

## 1. Stop selling off Council homes
In 2009, Southwark's Tory/Lib Dem administration introduced a policy of selling off every council home that becomes vacant and is valued above £400,000. In 2011 this was [reviewed by the incoming Labour administration which reduced](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s19458/Report%20Review%20of%20Void%20Disposal%20Strategy.pdf) the threshold to £300,000. [This compilation](http://35percent.org/img/sold_by_southwark.pdf) taken from auction websites shows a sample of some of the hundreds of properties sold off by the current administration in this [ongoing policy of disposals](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieDecisionDetails.aspx?AIId=48244).

[Research](http://www.londontenants.org/publications/other/Boroughs%20SR%20loss%20or%20gain%202001-17%20(FF4).jpg) by the [London Tenants Federation](http://londontenants.org) shows that Southwark has lost more social housing than any other borough. Selling off council homes for less than it [costs to build] new ones is not helping 

## 2. Stop selling off public land and buildings
It is not just council homes that are being sold off. Southwark's 'modernisation' drive has seen it [sell off both Bermondsey and Peckham Town Halls](http://35percent.org/southwark-town-halls/); Harper Rd Social Services Centre; Castle Day Centre; Whitstable Day Nursery; Abbey St Children's Home; and Wansey St Homeless Hostel:

Southwark has also been selling off land that it owns like this plot of empty warehouses off Braganza St and this strip.

The land at Ilderton Road was [sold outright](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieDecisionDetails.aspx?Id=5885) to a developer, as was [this former car pound](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieDecisionDetails.aspx?Id=6563) off the Old Kent Road, [this plot of land](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieIssueDetails.aspx?IId=50017404&PlanId=0&Opt=3#AI50577) at Devonshire Grove, [this plot of land](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieDecisionDetails.aspx?Id=3755) that was part of the Beacon House estate.  part of the  while the plot at Braganza Street is being developed in partnership with a developer as part of Southwark's SRPP partnership deal. Of the 33 new homes planned on this site, x will be private sale and x will be 'intermediate' tenure, not one will be social rent.
