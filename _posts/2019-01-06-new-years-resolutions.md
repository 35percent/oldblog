title: New Years Resolutions
subtitle: Ten things Southwark Council should do in 2019
---
To welcome the New Year and in a spirit of fraternity we have come up with ten things that Southwark Council can consider in order to ease the effects of the housing crisis and create a fairer future for the borough's residents.

## 1. Stop selling off Council homes
[Research](http://www.londontenants.org/publications/other/Boroughs%20SR%20loss%20or%20gain%202001-17%20(FF4).jpg) by the [London Tenants Federation](http://londontenants.org) shows that Southwark has lost more social housing than any other borough since 2001.

As well as [right to buy and estate demolitions](http://35percent.org/the-southwark-clearances/), homes are also being lost through the sale of 'high value' properties. 

In 2009, Southwark's Tory/Lib Dem administration introduced this policy for every council home valued above £400,000. In 2011 this was [reviewed and reduced to £300,000](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s19458/Report%20Review%20of%20Void%20Disposal%20Strategy.pdf) by the incoming Labour administration.

We don't know how many council homes have been sold under this policy to date, but [this compilation](http://35percent.org/img/sold_by_southwark.pdf) taken from auction websites shows a sample of over 50 properties sold off in this [ongoing policy of disposals](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieDecisionDetails.aspx?AIId=48244).

*A [sample](/sold_by_southwark.pdf) of hundreds of council homes sold by the current Labour administration under this policy*

Southwark's justification for this is that the sales revenue allows more council housing to be built more cheaply elsewhere in the borough, but the cost of building new social rented homes is surprisingly high and can [exceed the £300,000 threshold]().  The [Mayor's most recent annual monitoring report](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/amr_14_final_20180927.pdf) shows a net gain of just 84 social rented homes in the three years to 2016/17.

[£335k per home](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s75190/Report%20Gateway%202%20-%20Contract%20Award%20Construction%20of%20New%20Build%20Units%20at%20Pelier%20Street.pdf)

## 2. Stop selling off public land and buildings
It is not just council homes that are being sold off. Southwark's 'modernisation' drive has seen it [sell both Bermondsey and Peckham Town Halls](http://35percent.org/southwark-town-halls/); Harper Rd Social Services Centre; Castle Day Centre; Whitstable Day Nursery; Abbey St Children's Home; Willowbrook Community Centre and the Wansey St Homeless Hostel:

![](http://35percent.org/img/selloff2.png)

Land has also been sold, like [this plot of land near Milwall stadium](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieDecisionDetails.aspx?Id=5885) and [its former car pound](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieDecisionDetails.aspx?Id=6563) off the Old Kent Road, likewise [this plot of land](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieIssueDetails.aspx?IId=50017404&PlanId=0&Opt=3#AI50577) at Devonshire Grove and [this plot of land](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieDecisionDetails.aspx?Id=3755) on the Beacon House estate and [this one at Woods Road in Peckham](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieDecisionDetails.aspx?AIId=29450).

Meanwhile the council is developing further sites it owns under its [SRPP partnership programme](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/regeneration/southwark-regeneration-in-partnership-programme) in conjunction with developers. The site of the [council's former enterprise workshops in Kennington](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/regeneration/southwark-regeneration-in-partnership-programme?chapter=7) is one of the 20 sites currently planned. The SRPP is supposedly going to provide 33% council homes in its schemes but despite this and despite the [consultation process for this site promising 55% council homes](https://consultations.southwark.gov.uk/planning-and-regeneration/2nd-round-consultation-braganza-street-workshops/supporting_documents/Braganza%20Online.pdf), planning permission was granted last year for 33 new homes, 28 of which private, 5 intermediate and none social rent.

Land is a precious resource in Southwark as is council housing. If Southwark genuinely wants to deliver on its [failing manifesto promise](http://35percent.org/2018-11-12-11000-council-homes-manifesto-pledge/) to build 11,000 new council homes, then all of its surplus land should be ringfenced for building new council homes not for being sold off to developers.

## 3. Stop buying S106 homes from developers
We have [blogged](http://35percent.org/2018-11-12-11000-council-homes-manifesto-pledge/#buying-affordable-housing-instead) previously about the council buying affordable housing from developers to help deliver on its failing manifesto pledge. The problem with this method of buying council housing is that it does not actually increase the net supply of social housing - the same units would otherwise have been bought and let by a housing association anyway. Further, Southwark is denying itself the benefit of the S106 contribution, by paying for something a housing association would have paid for anyway - and, rather perversely, denying itself funds for building units that would actually increase the net supply.

## 4. Stop granting planning permission for schemes that don't comply with planning policy requirements
Our [research into major developments](http://35percent.org/img/major-schemes) approved in Southwark over the past 10 years has shown that out of a total of 11,863 new homes given planning consent, just 456 (3.8%) were social rented tenure. Had Southwark stood firm and forced these schemes to comply with minimum policy requirements then 2,500 social rented homes would have been approved in total.

## 5. Start monitoring and enforcing tenure requirements of Section 106 agreements
In May 2015 we [discovered](https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/southwark-council-probes-44-missing-social-homes/) that Notting Hill Housing association had provided affordable rent (up to 80% market) as part of its Bermondsey Spa Regeneration scheme. Following this we discovered 43 further schemes where this tenure switch appears to have taken place. After the Council dismissed our complaint we referred it to the Ombudsman who, after a lengthy investigation concluded that the Council _"did not have a systematic supervision procedure to check compliance"_ with the tenure provision requirements of its section 106 agreements. Instead _"it relied on developers’ voluntary compliance."_ The Ombudsman ordered Southwark to conduct an audit of S106 tenure provision and introduce monitoring/compliance procedures. 

![](http://35percent.org/img/LGOFinalDecisionSOR.png)

The Council initially [promised](https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/gov-report-finds-council-failed-years-monitor-developers-broken-promises-provide-social-housing/) that first 1 year audit would be published in 2017. It didn't happen. It later [explained that the audit was taking time because it was going back to 2010 and promised](https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/council-will-clamp-housing-providers-flunk-affordable-housing-promises/) that it would be completed in Spring 2018. Nearly three years have now passed since the Ombudsman decision and despite the chair of the planning committee [promising](https://twitter.com/cllrmseaton/status/1058056214230253573) to look into it, we are yet to see or hear anything of the audit.

## 4. Enforce the tenure requirements of the Heygate regeneration agreement
After Lendlease [tried to sue Harringey Council](https://www.insidehousing.co.uk/news/lendlease-sues-haringey-council-over-4bn-vehicle-59072) over its regeneration agreement for the redevelopment of a number of Council estates, we figured it's reasonable to ask Southwark to take legal action against Lendlease. It passed us by at the time that the [regeneration agreement](https://southwarknotes.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/ra.pdf) which was [accidentally leaked](https://www.newstatesman.com/news/2013/02/southwark-accidentally-leaks-confidential-information) in 2013, contains a provision requiring Lendlease to provide 50% of all affordable housing on site as social rent.

![](http://35percent.org/img/ratenuresplit.png)
*Extract from the Council's [regeneration agreement](https://southwarknotes.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/ra.pdf) with Lendlease*

Southwark should take action requiring Lendlease to comply with the terms of its legal agreement. This would result in the provision of 432 social rented homes on the redeveloped estate, not the pitiful 74 that Lendlease [managed to get away with](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jun/25/london-developers-viability-planning-affordable-social-housing-regeneration-oliver-wainwright) through the planning process. It's important to remember that the planning process and the legal agreement are two entirely separate things. Just because Lendlease pulled the wool over the eyes of the planning committee doesn't stop the Council's regeneration department from enforcing the terms of its contractual agreement with Lendlease. 

## 5. Aylesbury break clause
We have [shown previously](http://35percent.org/the-southwark-clearances/) how Southwark's estate regeneration programmes have devastated its social housing stock. The redevelopment of the Aylesbury estate will result in the net loss of between 778 and 1,166 social rented homes - that's presupposing that Notting Hill Genesis lets the new homes as social rent not affordable rent [as it has done in other schemes](https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/council-takes-no-legal-action-over-44-missing-social-housing-units/). Notting Hill Genesis has got track records in this regard, as documented [here]( http://35percent.org/2017-01-16-draft-more-on-notting-hill/#former-notting-hill-exec-spills-beans-on-ceo), [here](https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2015/aug/14/social-housing-britain-future-profit-purpose-genesis), [here](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/13/fury-affordable-homes-redeveloped-sold-housing-associations), [here](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/13/fury-affordable-homes-redeveloped-sold-housing-associations) and [here](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/24/london-social-housing-sell-off-protest-luxury-hotel).

![](http://35percent.org/img/aylesburynetloss.png)
*Extract from the Council's Aylsebury estate redevelopment planning committee report(ref:14/AP/3843)*

It has also been [revealed](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/sep/12/london-council-aylesbury-estate-development-southwark-financial-risk) that Southwark could end up making a substantial loss on the sale of the 60 acre estate, while Notting Hill Genesis enjoys a ring-fenced profit.  

## 6. Stop wasting money trying to gentrify Southwark
Mountview Academy given plot of land behind Peckham library and a 24m interest free loan plus 2m grant to build new (private) drama school. Fees are xx per year for an undergrad and xx per year for postgraduate study at the school. Besides a few low-cost oversubscribed Saturday morning drama classes this is not a...

![](http://35percent.org/img/mview.jpg)



At the same time as finding 26m for Mountview Southwark claims that it hasn't got any money to refurbish Walworth Town Hall.

Mountview board includes Lady Susan Chinn, wife of [Labour donor Sir Trevor Chinn](https://www.totalpolitics.com/articles/news/sir-trevor-chinn-becomes-latest-labour-donor-fund-dan-jarvis-machine), Sir Brendan Barbour, Vikki Heywood (CBE) and [Eddie Marsan](https://twitter.com/eddiemarsan).

Mountview not even [Living Wage employer](https://www.livingwage.org.uk/accredited-living-wage-employers)

the establishment of a school focused on a let’s face it, very middle class and very white profession, raises questions of engagement with the mostly working class and minority ethnic communities of Peckham.

## 7. Stop buying speculative commercial developments from developers
Shortly before Christmas, Southwark's Cabinet agreed to the purchase of 'Courage Yard', a commercial development next door to Council leader Peter John's residence in Shad Thames. SE1 website [reports](https://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/9791) that the Council is paying £89m for the site - nearly twice what the current owner paid for it in 2015.

According to [this Council report](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s76412/Report%20Treasury%20Management%20Outturn.pdf) (para 21) Southwark owns £232m worth of such commercial investments, which currently provide a total of £9.2m per year in revenue (3.9% return). 

The same report confirms that Southwark is currently £563m in debt (para 1) and is paying 4.6% on this debt (para 41). 

Is Southwark not better of paying off or reducing its debt?
Better still it could use the £89m to build new council homes in order to reduce the £10m per year it is spending on bed & breakfast accommodation, or as the Walworth Society suggest, refurbishing Walworth Town Hall along with some commercial, revenue producing activities.
