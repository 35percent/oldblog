subtitle: Ten things Southwark Council should do in 2019
---
To welcome the New Year and in a spirit of fraternity we have come up with ten things that Southwark Council can consider in order to ease the effects of the housing crisis and create a fairer future for the borough's residents.

## 1. Stop selling off Council homes
[Research](http://www.londontenants.org/publications/other/Boroughs%20SR%20loss%20or%20gain%202001-17%20(FF4).jpg) by the [London Tenants Federation](http://londontenants.org) shows that Southwark has lost more social housing than any other borough since 2001.

As well as [right to buy and estate demolitions](http://35percent.org/the-southwark-clearances/), homes are also being lost through the sale of 'high value' properties, introduced in 2009, Southwark's Tory/Lib Dem administration for vacant council homes valued above £400,000. In 2011 this was [reviewed and reduced to £300,000](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s19458/Report%20Review%20of%20Void%20Disposal%20Strategy.pdf) by the incoming Labour administration.

We don't know how many council homes have been sold under this policy to date, but [this compilation](http://35percent.org/img/sold_by_southwark.pdf) taken from auction websites shows a sample of over 50 properties sold off in this [ongoing policy of disposals](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieDecisionDetails.aspx?AIId=48244).

*A [sample](/sold_by_southwark.pdf) of hundreds of council homes sold by the current Labour administration under this policy*

Southwark's justification for this is that the sales revenue allows more council housing to be built more cheaply elsewhere in the borough, but the cost of building new social rented homes is surprisingly high and can [exceed the £300,000 threshold]().  The [Mayor's most recent annual monitoring report](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/amr_14_final_20180927.pdf) shows a net gain of just 84 social rented homes in the three years to 2016/17.

## 2. Stop selling off public land and buildings
Southwark's 'modernisation' drive has also seen it sell off public buildings and land including [both Bermondsey and Peckham Town Halls](http://35percent.org/southwark-town-halls/); Harper Rd Social Services Centre; Castle Day Centre; Whitstable Day Nursery; Abbey St Children's Home; Willowbrook Community Centre and the Wansey St Homeless Hostel.

Land sold includes [a plot near Millwall stadium](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieDecisionDetails.aspx?Id=5885) and Southwark's [former car pound](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieDecisionDetails.aspx?Id=6563) off the Old Kent Road, likewise [a plot of land](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieIssueDetails.aspx?IId=50017404&PlanId=0&Opt=3#AI50577) at Devonshire Grove and [a plot of land](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieDecisionDetails.aspx?Id=3755) on the Beacon House estate and [ one at Woods Road in Peckham](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieDecisionDetails.aspx?AIId=29450).

The Mayor's [new draft London Plan](https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/planning/london-plan/new-london-plan/what-new-london-plan) introduces a requirement that 50% of new housing developments on public land [should be affordable](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/draft_london_plan_chapter_4.pdf) so whatever immediate gains these sales bring, the imperative should be retaining as much land in public ownership as possible, to take full advantage of this change.

## 3. No more approvals like this...

If Southwark is serious about fulfilling its [manifesto promise](http://35percent.org/2018-11-12-11000-council-homes-manifesto-pledge/) to build 11000 council homes there must be no more approvals of developments like Braganza St, on the site of the [council's former enterprise workshops in Kennington](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/regeneration/southwark-regeneration-in-partnership-programme?chapter=7) and one of 20 sites in [Southwark's Regeneration Partnership Programme (SRRP)](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/regeneration/southwark-regeneration-in-partnership-programme),its flagship council house delivery programme. Despite the [consultation process for this site promising 55% council homes](https://consultations.southwark.gov.uk/planning-and-regeneration/2nd-round-consultation-braganza-street-workshops/supporting_documents/Braganza%20Online.pdf), planning permission was granted last year for 33 new homes, 28 of which private, 5 intermediate and none social rent or council housing.

## 4. Stop granting planning permission for schemes that don't comply with planning policy requirements
Our [research into major developments](http://35percent.org/img/major-schemes) approved in Southwark over the past 10 years has shown that out of a total of 11,863 new homes given planning consent, just 456 (3.8%) were social rented tenure. Had Southwark stood firm and forced these schemes to comply with minimum policy requirements then 2,500 social rented homes would have been approved in total.

## 5. Stop buying S106 homes from developers
We have [blogged](http://35percent.org/2018-11-12-11000-council-homes-manifesto-pledge/#buying-affordable-housing-instead) previously about the council buying affordable housing from developers to help deliver on its failing manifesto pledge. The problem with this method of buying council housing is that it does not actually increase the net supply of social housing - the same units would otherwise have been bought and let by a housing association anyway. Further, Southwark is denying itself the benefit of the S106 contribution, by paying for something a housing association would have paid for anyway - and, rather perversely, denying itself funds for building units that would actually increase the net supply.

## 6. Start monitoring and enforcing tenure requirements of Section 106 agreements
In May 2015 we [discovered](https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/southwark-council-probes-44-missing-social-homes/) that Notting Hill Housing association had provided affordable rent (up to 80% market) as part of its Bermondsey Spa Regeneration scheme. Following this we discovered 43 further schemes where this tenure switch appears to have taken place. After the Council dismissed our complaint we referred it to the Ombudsman who, after a lengthy investigation concluded that the Council _"did not have a systematic supervision procedure to check compliance"_ with the tenure provision requirements of its section 106 agreements. Instead _"it relied on developers’ voluntary compliance."_ The Ombudsman ordered Southwark to conduct an audit of S106 tenure provision and introduce monitoring/compliance procedures.

The Council initially [promised](https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/gov-report-finds-council-failed-years-monitor-developers-broken-promises-provide-social-housing/) that first 1 year audit would be published in 2017. It didn't happen. It later [explained that the audit was taking time because it was going back to 2010 and promised](https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/council-will-clamp-housing-providers-flunk-affordable-housing-promises/) that it would be completed in Spring 2018. Nearly three years have now passed since the Ombudsman decision and despite the chair of the planning committee [promising](https://twitter.com/cllrmseaton/status/1058056214230253573) to look into it, we are yet to see or hear anything of the audit.

## 7. Canada Water and transparency

Southwark has made a [legendary committment](https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/southwark-councils-new-policy-will-stop-developers-copping-out-of-affordable-housing-obligations/) on viability assessments. To be of any value this should extend to all development related documents, including development partnership agreements with private developers. In October last year we requested a copy of the Council's partnership agreement with British Land for the [gargantuan Canada Water redevelopment plans](http://35percent.org/canada-water/#british-land-masterplan-site) (46 acres of Council freehold land, more than 3000 new homes). After two and a half months it was [released](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/partnership_agreement_for_redeve#incoming-1281908), in heavily redacted form - all financial and viability details, affordable housing provisions, pubic open space requirements and developer's protected profit levels were completely redacted.

## 8. Keep Walworth Townhall

Refer to Courage Yard £89m 

## 9. Treat Elephant traders fairly

Perronet House rents to be same as Castle Sq.

 

## 6. Stop wasting money trying to gentrify Southwark
Mountview Academy given plot of land behind Peckham library and a 24m interest free loan plus 2m grant to build new (private) drama school. Fees are £13k per year for an undergrad and £17k per year for postgraduate study at the school. Besides a few low-cost oversubscribed Saturday morning drama classes this academy offers little for local people. £26m of Council money for the establishment of a school focused on let’s face it, a very middle class and very white profession, raises questions of engagement with the mostly working class and minority ethnic communities of Peckham.

![](http://35percent.org/img/mview.jpg)

At the same time as finding 26m for Mountview Southwark claims that it hasn't got any money to refurbish Walworth Town Hall.

Mountview board includes some high-profile Labour party supporters including Lady Susan Chinn, wife of [Labour donor Sir Trevor Chinn](https://www.totalpolitics.com/articles/news/sir-trevor-chinn-becomes-latest-labour-donor-fund-dan-jarvis-machine), Sir Brendan Barbour, Vikki Heywood (CBE) and [Eddie Marsan](https://twitter.com/eddiemarsan).

## 7. Stop buying speculative commercial developments from developers
Shortly before Christmas, Southwark's Cabinet agreed to the purchase of 'Courage Yard', a commercial development next door to Council leader Peter John's residence in Shad Thames. SE1 website [reports](https://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/9791) that the Council is paying £89m for the site - nearly twice what the current owner paid for it in 2015.

According to [this Council report](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s76412/Report%20Treasury%20Management%20Outturn.pdf) (para 21) Southwark owns £232m worth of such commercial investments, which currently provide a total of £9.2m per year in revenue (3.9% return). 

The same report confirms that Southwark is currently £563m in debt (para 1) and is paying 4.6% on this debt (para 41). 

Is Southwark not better of paying off or reducing its debt?
Better still it could use the £89m to build new council homes in order to reduce the £10m per year it is spending on bed & breakfast accommodation, or as the Walworth Society suggest, refurbishing Walworth Town Hall along with some commercial, revenue producing activities.
