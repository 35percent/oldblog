The __35% campaign__ can reveal that Southwark Council is taking legal action against some of the *'parties'* involved in the development of the old Hartley Jam Factory.  Southwark allege that affordable housing was not provided in accordance with the planning consent for the site. The action has come to light in a response to a [Freedom of Information request](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/hartleys_jam_factory_redevelopme?unfold=1#incoming-786348) made by the __35% campaign__. 
![Redeveloped Hartleys Jam Factory](http://s0.geograph.org.uk/geophotos/01/76/63/1766372_bd88bcf1.jpg)

Southwark is alleging various breaches of the S106 legal agreement in relation to 18 affordable housing units.  The alleged breaches involve *'sham transactions'* to conceal what the Council believes was *'the true intention of the parties, namely to issue long leases to property investors for let and sale on the open market'.*

Southwark also alleges that affordable housing flats were '*sold to 2 property investment vehicles in 2014; 2 flats sold very quickly to owner-occupiers, remaining 16 marketed for sales in China'.*

Southwark issued a High Court claim in June 2015 and obtained an interim injunction in August 2015, preventing the onward-sale of the 16 flats to the overseas buyers, although it appears that they are still being [advertised for sale online](http://www.curtisjoneslondon.com/property/-rothsay-street--london-se1/cjl-000926/1).  Southwark is now negotiating with the owners of the flats sold, for their transfer to a registered provider of affordable housing.  The owners are maintaining a claim against Southwark for compensation.

Southwark is pursuing its own damages claim against the registered provider of the Jam Factory's affordable housing.  It is also pursuing a claim against the registered provider in respect of two other un-named sites.  On a fourth site, Southwark has obtained an order for a *'pre-action disclosure'* earlier in March this year, against the registered provider and two companies that Southwark believe 'hold the "real interest" in the flats'.  Southwark are also considering the potential for a further claim, for the return of 11 flats to use as affordable housing.

These startling revelations are the latest twists in the Jam Factory's chequered development history, detailed in the [SE1 Website](http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/2759).  Its original permission was granted in 2000 and was for 154 units, twenty four affordable, with 159 parking spaces, across 5 blocks.

However in 2007 Southwark discovered that only four blocks had been built and one of those had been *"erected to a different form and external appearance .. *(and)* 1 storey higher"* than the original permission.  There were also 171 homes, 17 more than the number consented, but with no affordable housing provided whatsoever.  This was outlined in [this Oct 2007 planning committee report.](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7B%7B%7B!QpNXNOpcqBPKtQ8S0s9rgw==!%7D%7D%7D)

The Council resolved to deal with the breach in planning consent with two [retrospective applications](http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/2759).  The first would see the 18 live/work units in block D converted to shared ownership and Block E, would be built providing 20 social rented units as follows:

![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/YM6Xv7a.png)

This was to bring the overall affordable housing provision on the site to 96 habitable rooms, of which 34 would be social rented - still not policy compliant, but acceptable to the Council;

However, after successful lobbying by residents of the now-occupied blocks A-C, the planning committee [rejected](http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/2969) the Block E application and so now there's not a single social rented (or affordable rented) home in the development; and the 18 shared ownership units that were agreed are subject to the enforcement actions detailed above. 

The housing association involved in the Jam Factory was ['Faithland housing Association Ltd'](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!Tsbo%2fPyblNef2Qbj1JwRIw%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) which has since become [London District Housing Association](http://www.londondha.com/about_us.php) and which has [several other developments](http://www.londondha.com/locations.php) in Southwark. This is despite not being a registered charity like most housing associations and despite the fact that it is not on Southwark’s list of approved housing providers. __London District__ also appears to have a very close relationship with developer [Galliard Homes](http://www.galliardhomes.com/), sharing directors and registered addresses[^1].   Galliard also appears to have had a close relationship with the (now liquidated) Jam Factory developers ([Angel Property Ltd.](https://opencorporates.com/companies/gb/05032182)), sharing directors and registered addresses with its financiers[^2]. Galliard has a large number of other developments in Southwark and some of these are listed on our  [schedule of alleged identified breaches](http://35percent.org/images/section106_tenure_breaches.pdf) which we sent to the Council as part of a corporate complaint, at the end of last year. This  complaint is still being pursued by us, after a first stage rejection by Southwark.

We can at least applaud what looks like resolute action by Southwark Council in the Jam Factory case, but there are still at least two big questions to be answered – how did we reach this sorry state in the first place? And how many more private developments are cheating Southwark of desperately needed affordable housing?  We need a borough-wide investigation to resolve these questions.
