## Sadiq gives Grosvenor a second chance

We [blogged](http://35percent.org/2018-09-25-grosvenor-taking-the-biscuit-factory/) back in 2018 about the redevelopment of the former Peek Freens biscuit factory and adjoining college campus site, in Bermondsey.

Grovesnor Estate, headed by Hugh Grosvenor the 7th Duke of Westminster, London's [largest landowner](https://whoownsengland.org/2017/10/28/who-owns-central-london/) and the world's richest man under 30 (worth over £10bn), proposed 1,343 new homes, none of which were to be social rent. The site is next door to two Bermondsey wards with some of the deprived neighourhoods in the country and the complete lack of any social housing was too much for both local councillors and Southwark's planning committee, who early last year rejected the scheme.

However, Mayor Sadiq Khan overrode Southwark's decision by 'calling it in', citing Southwark's [failure to meet its affordable housing targets](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/public%3A//public%3A//PAWS/media_id_458537///biscuit_factory_final_decision.pdf), and is now [set to approve the scheme](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/biscuit_factory_hearing_report.pdf), after a [public hearing](https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/planning/planning-applications-and-decisions/public-hearings/former-biscuit-factory-public-hearing-0) at City Hall on the 21st February.

## Still no proper social rent

The scheme has been amended, with an overall increase in the number of homes, by 206 units, including 160 affordable, up to 1,548 units in total.  But because the scheme remains a Build to Rent (BtR), with none of the homes for sale, there will still be no proper social rented housing. Instead 140 of the 160 affordable units will be 'social rent equivalent'(SRE) - a pseudo social rent on 3 year tenancies, not the assured or secure tenancies of social rented housing, which are generally lifetime.  There is only a 'presumption' that SRE tenancies will be renewed at the end of the 3 years.

The SRE rents will be Target Rents, the lowest level usually adopted for new build social rent, but still higher than Southwark council rents, according to an early [draft of the New Southwark Plan](   https://www.southwark.gov.uk/assets/attach/5811/NSP-PSV-FINAL.pdf).  One bed would be £134pw, compared to council rent of £107pw; two bed £160pw (council rent £126pw), three-bed £169pw (council rent £146pw), four-bed £178pw (£157pw).  The SRE service charges, which could increase the disparity significantly, are a unquantified mystery, with only the assurance that they will be _'controlled'_ (para 249).

## Discount Market Rent - 'genuinely affordable'?

Most of the affordable housing, though, is made up of Discounted Market Rent (DMR) - 343 units to be let at much higher rents than SRE, £354pw (one bed), £301pw, (two bed) £323pw (three beds).  It is not clear if these rents include service charge, or why the one-bed is higher than the two and three-beds (para 250).  In any event, they are described as '_genuinely affordable_' (para 251).  There will be no units let at London Living Rent, despite being the Mayor's preferred rent level, which would have reduced the DMR rents to £242pw, £269pw, £296 respectively.

Many of the other provisions are familiar from the proposed development of the [Elephant and Castle Shopping Centre](http://35percent.org/shopping-centre/), also a BtR development.  As at the Elephant, a well-founded fear that BtR developments will just be sold onto the free-market, means a legal covenant is needed to ensure BtR developments remain for rent, not for sale. The convenant for the Biscuit Factory is only for 20 years though, whereas Southwark required thirty years from developer Delancey for the shopping centre; in any event the covenant does not entirely stop a developer selling on, if they are prepared to pay a penalty, known as 'claw-back'.

## (Another) non-viable development. 

At the bottom of the poor affordable housing offer is the developer's well-worn claim that this is a non-viable development.  A non-viable development is one where the developer's own profit target is not met, not one where it makes no money.  In this case Grosvenor own profit target is [12% IRR](https://docdro.id/SEWzVwi), and they say they can make barely half that, 6.53%, and the affordable housing offer is the best they can do. GLA and Southwark agrees, but any confidence we can have in these judgements is undermined by hugh disparity in the estimates of profits; Grovesnor estimated they would make a £10m loss on the original 2017 planning application £189m loss, while Southwark said they would make £101m profit.   Now Grosvenor claims a profit of £13m on the amended scheme.  We do not know the GLA profit estimate, because it has not published it's own appraisal, depite its commitment to tranparency (ref needed).

As a sop, early and late stage reviews of the scheme are offered and should there be any increase in profitability extra social rent equivalent or London Living Rent homes will be provided, but only by reducing the DMR rents, not by converting market-rent units, so there will be no increase in the number of affordable units.

## Bad day for Southwark, worse day for the Mayor

In October 2018 Southwark's regeneration boss, Cllr Johnson Situ, [commented](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/oct/26/grosvenor-1bn-bermondsey-build-to-rent-project-in-jeopardy-duke-of-westminster-property-group) on the original application:_"With over 10,000 people on our housing waiting list it is very disappointing to see such a little amount of social or genuinely affordable housing in this application. As it stands, we are still a long way from agreeing a scheme that meets the council’s policies."_

Southwark has followed this up by making a representation on the amended scheme to GLA, reiterating some of the objections that led to the original scheme's rejection, but it has not argued for the amount of real social rented housing that its own policy requires - 35% of the total amount of housing, divided 70:30 between proper social rent and intermediate housing.  This would give us around 380 social rented homes and 162 DMR homes.

Indeed, it is arguable that the affordable housing requirement should be 50%, giving us 540 social rented homes. The [GLA report](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/biscuit_factory_hearing_report.pdf)
recommending approval of the scheme skips lightly over the requirement that, as a former industrial site, the Biscuit Factory should deliver 50% affordable housing, in line with the The Mayor's 'strategic' target, by saying _'the site currently comprises a privately-owned commercial complex, the previous industrial use having ceased over 30 years ago'_(footnote; para 232) and so is subject to a 35% requirement instead.


While Southwark has been reduced to a bystander in the decision making, GLA has indulged in a pick n mix of the [bewildering number of affordable housing policies](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/biscuit_factory_hearing_report.pdf) (Footnote; see paras 220-236) available to determine that only 140 pseudo-social rent homes should be built, with 342 DMR at much higher rents - an exact reversal of the proportions of social to intermediate housing, given by Southwark's policy.

So, in sum, a Labour Mayor has called in a development that a Labour council has rightly refused because it has no social rented housing, ignored that council's own affordable housing policies, and applied his own, weaker policies, all to help a developer build something without any proper social rented housing.

## Poor doors

There is much else not to like about the development.
One of Sadiq Khan's manifesto pledges was that he would [ban poor door's in London's housing developments](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/23/sadiq-khan-pledges-ban-poor-doors-london-housing-developments-mayor). He has held true on this pledge to the extent that separate entrances for private and affordable tenants are indeed a thing of the past and instead we now see entirely separate buildings (see Heygate, Aylesbury and most major schemes approved in last 5 years.)

## Renewable energy
Despite both the Mayor and Southwark Council having formally declared a 'climate emergency', Grosvenor's scheme fails to comply with the either the Mayor's or Southwark's minimum 20% requirement for on-site renewable energy supply.

[Policy 5.7 (para 5.42) of the Mayor's new London Plan](https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/planning/london-plan/current-london-plan/london-plan-chapter-five-londons-response/poli-6) requires that _" all major development proposals will seek to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by at least 20 per cent through the use of on-site renewable energy generation"_ .. via the use of _"renewable energy technologies such as: biomass heating; cooling and electricity; renewable energy from waste; photovoltaics; solar water heating; wind and heat pumps"_.  

Southwark's sustainability policies also require this minimum 20% on-site renewable energy generation (see policy 13 of the Core Strategy) and Policy 3.5 of its [Sustainability SPD](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/assets/attach/1820/Sustainable_Design_and_Construction_SPD.pdf):

![](http://35percent.org/img/sustainabilityspd.png)


Grosvenor's [Energy Assessment](http://35percent.org/img/EnergyAssessment.pdf) proposes just 0.7% renewable energy generation (see para 7.6) using a handful of solar panels and some air conditioning units in the commercial units that can also provide heat.

## Why we have a housing crisis

The Biscuit Factory demonstrates why we do not have enough homes that people can actually afford to live in.
A site that could have delivered 50% affordable housing (750 units), of which 525 would be social rented, if the Mayor had abided by Southwark's adopted policy and the site had been treated as former industrial land, is only delivering 140 pseudo-social rent, plus 20 Discounted Market Rent. Even if the 50% were reduced to 35%, there would have provided around 380 social rented units.
Through the wileness of developers, aided by like-minded policy-makers, 

## More Build to Rent, less Social Rent

The Biscuit Factory also demonstrates the threat BtR developments hold for social rented housing.  Build to rent schemes do not provide social rented housing, only a pseudo-social housing and very little of it.The more Build to Rent schemes we have in London the less social rented houisng there will be.

Both the Gosvenor and the Mayor would have us believe that 'social rent equivalent' is the same as social rent - it isn't; it is a pseudo-social rent homes

## Conclusion

 Mayor cited Southwark's failure to meet housing targets; justifiable, but his concern is headline figures, hopes that no-one will notice what kind of aff/h. Need for social housing (Southwark table, ward indices); Mayor's pre-election promises on social housing. Tradeable commodity. Mayor likes - institutional finance.




Hearing 21 Feb 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The scheme is still 240 social rented homes away from meeting the council's policies so why has Cllr Situ now dropped his opposition to the scheme and what the hell is the Mayor doing? 

In the end it settles on that which provides pseudo-social rent (and not much of it), relying on the Mayor's so-called Intend To Publish London Plan.  This takes takes precedence over Southwark's long-standing and adopted Core Strategy, which would have given proper social rent, at higher proportions, and Southwark's emerging New Southwark Plan, also unpublished, which would have allowed pseudo- social rent, but would at least got more of it.

## Policy pick n' mix

GLA considers a [bewildering number of affordable housing policies] (https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/biscuit_factory_hearing_report.pdf)(Footnote; paras 220-236) when determing what kind of affordable housing should be built and how much there should be.  In the end it settles on that which provides pseudo-social rent (and not much of it), relying on the Mayor's so-called Intend To Publish London Plan.  This takes takes precedence over Southwark's long-standing and adopted Core Strategy, which would have given proper social rent, at higher proportions, and Southwark's emerging New Southwark Plan, also unpublished, which would have allowed pseudo- social rent, but would at least got more of it.
