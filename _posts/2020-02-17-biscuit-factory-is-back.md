## Sadiq gives Grosvenor a second chance

We [blogged](http://35percent.org/2018-09-25-grosvenor-taking-the-biscuit-factory/) back in 2018 about Bermondsey's biscuit factory redevelopment.

Grovesnor Estate, headed by Hugh Grosvenor the 7th Duke of Westminster, London's [largest landowner](https://whoownsengland.org/2017/10/28/who-owns-central-london/) and the world's richest man under 30 (worth over £10bn), proposed 1,343 new homes, none of which were social rent. The site is next door to two Bermondsey wards with some of the deprived neighourhoods in the country and the complete lack of any social housing was too much for both local councillors and Southwark's planning committee, who rejected the scheme, early last year.

However, Mayor Sadiq Khan overrode Southwark's decision by 'calling it in', citing Southwark's failure to meet housing targets and now looks set to approve the scheme on 21st February. 

The scheme has been altered by the Mayor with an overall increase in the number of homes to 1,548 and the introduction of 140 pseudo social rented homes. - social rent equivalent;3 year tenancy; rent? FOI, our estimate from viability assessment - GLA won't say, wait until s106 is approved (consultation conducted on this basis).  Covenant length? 

This time there are 140 homes proposed at social rent equivalent.  Under Southwark's local plan we shold get c 380 proper s/rent, based on units.

(Another) non-viable development. Whatever confidence there might be in viability undermined by hugh disparity in figures - in 2017 planning application £189m loss (Grosvnor); £101m profit (Southwark; now Grosvenor claim the profit will be £13m (not agreed by GLA?).  This falls below Grosvenor own profit target of xxx% IRR and so classes the develoment as  non-viable.  Does it qualify for the fast track? (H6) Review? Yes - Stage 2 report.  This is justification for an affordable housing offer that still does not meet Southwark's policy requirements (adopted or emerging).

Officer's report 5 working days, hearing 21 Feb 

This still falls short of Southwark's policy requirement. Southwark Plan and London Plan both moving in same direction - support for BtR, fake social rent and less off it.

Cllr Johnson Situ, Southwark's regeneration boss had [said](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/oct/26/grosvenor-1bn-bermondsey-build-to-rent-project-in-jeopardy-duke-of-westminster-property-group) about the previous application:_"With over 10,000 people on our housing waiting list it is very disappointing to see such a little amount of social or genuinely affordable housing in this application. As it stands, we are still a long way from agreeing a scheme that meets the council’s policies."_

The scheme is still 240 social rented homes away from meeting the council's policies so why has Cllr Situ now dropped his opposition to the scheme and what the hell is the Mayor doing?  Mayor cited Southwark's failure to meet housing targets; justifiable, but his concern is headline figures, hopes that no-one will notice what kind of aff/h. Need for social housing (Southwark table, ward indices); Mayor's pre-election promises on social housing. Tradeable commodity. Mayor likes - institutional finance.

## Poor doors
One of Sadiq Khan's manifesto pledges was that he would [ban poor door's in London's housing developments](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/23/sadiq-khan-pledges-ban-poor-doors-london-housing-developments-mayor). He has held true on this pledge to the extent that separate entrances for private and affordable tenants are indeed a thing of the past and instead we now see entirely separate buildings (see Heygate, Aylesbury and most major schemes approved in last 5 years.)

## Renewable energy
Despite both the Mayor and Southwark Council having formally declared a 'climate emergency', Grosvenor's scheme fails to comply with the either the Mayor's or Southwark's minimum 20% requirement for on-site renewable energy supply.

[Policy 5.7 (para 5.42) of the Mayor's new London Plan](https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/planning/london-plan/current-london-plan/london-plan-chapter-five-londons-response/poli-6) requires that _" all major development proposals will seek to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by at least 20 per cent through the use of on-site renewable energy generation"_ .. via the use of _"renewable energy technologies such as: biomass heating; cooling and electricity; renewable energy from waste; photovoltaics; solar water heating; wind and heat pumps"_.  

Southwark's sustainability policies also require this minimum 20% on-site renewable energy generation (see policy 13 of the Core Strategy) and Policy 3.5 of its [Sustainability SPD](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/assets/attach/1820/Sustainable_Design_and_Construction_SPD.pdf):

Grosvenor's [Energy Assessment](http://35percent.org/img/EnergyAssessment.pdf) proposes just 0.7% renewable energy generation (see para 7.6) using a handful of solar panels and some air conditioning units in the commercial units that can also provide heat.
