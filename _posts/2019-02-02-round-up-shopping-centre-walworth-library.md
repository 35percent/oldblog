## public land given to delancey

[Land Registry Records](http://35percent.org/lrdeeds/shoppingcentreCouncilFreeholdLand.pdf) show that the Council is handing over a considerable amount of public land to Delancey for its disastrous and inqequitable redevelopment of the E&C shopping centre.

## NailHouses
[Land Registry Records](http://35percent.org/lrdeeds/scnewsagents.pdf) show that the buildings comprising the newsagents and the [Dental Practice](http://35percent.org/lrdeeds/32NKR.pdf) and above flats are still in private freehold ownership.

## Commercially confidential
On 22nd January, the Council [approved](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s79801/Report%20New%20Library%20and%20Heritage%20Centre%20for%20Walworth.pdf) the purchase of a shop from Lendlease on the latest phase to complete of 'Elephant Park' - aka Heygate estate. The Council's report said that the shop would be leased to the Council so that it could use it on a peppercorn lease in return for a 'premium' which was disclosed in the confidential closed report to Cabinet:

However, with a little digging we managed to uncover the premium buried in the Council's [forward budgeting plan](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s80185/Appendix%20C%20Budget%20Virements%20and%20Variations%20at%20Month%208%202018-19.pdf):

This £6m figure would also of course include fit-out costs. We asked the deputy Council leader how much of the £6m was fit out and how much was going to Lendlease as the 'premium'. Here's her [response:](https://twitter.com/rebeccalury/status/1090900899403362304)

The [planning committee report](moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s34476/Report.pdf) for the Heygate application said that there would be a minimum of 1,000 square metres of community space:

The report even suggested a library as one of the possible uses for the community space:

So what has happened? Why is Lendlease instead selling Southwark a retail unit (that it will have to get planning permission for change of use to community use)!!

Is this yet another example of Southwark getting rolled over by Lendlease? Hasn't it learned its lesson?

Why can't Southwark spend its £6m on refurbishing the existing library?
