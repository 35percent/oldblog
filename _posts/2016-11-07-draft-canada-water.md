Decathlon site bought originally for £500k but the viability assessment said value of land was £25m.
Viability assessment obtained via whatdotheyknow.com
Land registry documents links etc are in the classeur drafts and the canada-water web page.

Make the point that the site should have been valued as a retail store. Interestingly the independent viability assessment for neighbouring leisure park site suggested that rateable values should be obtained from the council and then capitalised to produce the benchmark existing use value - good suggestion! why is this not in Mayor's new guidance?
