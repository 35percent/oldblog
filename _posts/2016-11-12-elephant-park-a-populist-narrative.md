Are you __a)__ someone in Southwark in desperate need of a home?
  or __b)__ a property investor in Hong Kong or Singapore?

 * If __a)__ join the lengthening council waiting list for a council home, if 
   you can.
 * if __b)__ welcome to the Elephant and Castle, there is a good investment 
   opportunity waiting for you.

This is the conclusion of our own investigation into who will live on the new 
Heygate estate. It was prompted by recent press apologetics for gentrification. 

First up, Guardian columnist, Labour hack and [gentrification 
advocate](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/oct/24/lets-get-our-gentrification-story-straight) 
Dave Hill, has written an 
[article](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/nov/01/london-housing-sadiq-khan-research-brief-recognises-need-for-overseas-investors) 
claiming that foreign buyers have been wrongly scapegoated for the high cost of 
housing the capital.

The article refers to research being commissioned by City Hall, which is 
attempting to address not only  _'concerns about the role that overseas money 
plays in London’s property market'_, but also _"the positive role that overseas 
buyers play in enabling developments to go ahead."_
 
Hill dismisses the 'populist narrative' around overseas buyers and argues that 
_"a considerable amount of London’s new “affordable” homes aimed at people on 
low and middle incomes, are built as a condition of permission being granted 
for large, foreigner-financed housing schemes to go ahead. "_ 

Dave Hill is quite right; planning permissions are often given on condition 
that affordable housing is built, but unfortunately the promise is seldom kept.  

This has been amply demonstrated by London Tenants Federation's 
[analysis](http://35percent.org/2016-05-07-southwark-in-bottom-3-boroughs-for-affordable-housing-delivery/) 
of the latest available figures on affordable housing delivery, which shows 
that less than 1 in 5 new homes being built are affordable and only 1 in 10 
social rented - half the London Mayor's target in both cases.

The Evening Standard has recently provided us with a [case 
study](/img/standard26102016.pdf) of one such _'foreigner-financed housing 
scheme'_ 
- __Elephant Park__ (Heygate as was). A perfect test, we thought, of whether 
  [gifting public 
land](http://35percent.org/2016-05-11-no-profit-share-the-true-value-of-the-heygate-regeneration/) 
and resources to private developers actually delivers affordable housing.

## South (East Asia) Gardens

![](/img/southgardenpoint.JPG)

The latest phase of Elephant Park is [South 
Gardens](http://www.elephantpark.co.uk/elephant-park/explore-the-development/south-garden) 
which has 360 homes. Above is plot H06 (D,E & F) otherwise known as 'South 
Garden Point'. It comprises two blocks with 179 apartments, all for private 
sale. The UK sales launch [began this 
week](https://github.com/35percent/35percent.github.io/blob/master/img/southgardensuklaunch.jpg), 
with prices starting at £550k, but it’s really just to mop up what's left from 
the Singapore sales which [started on 11th April 
2014](http://www.propertyguru.com.sg/property-management-news/2014/4/37646/elephant-park-sales-in-singapore).  

We don't know how many units have been sold to overseas buyers because 
Lendlease and the Council [won't say](https://youtu.be/WZRV4KMxuEk), but [Land 
Registry 
information](https://github.com/35percent/35percent.github.io/blob/master/img/LRegisterSouthGardens.pdf) 
tells us that it is at least 46. They have been sold via international real 
estate firm [Colliers International](http://www.colliers.com/en-us) in Hong 
Kong and Singapore. Colliers' [sales 
brochure](https://github.com/35percent/35percent.github.io/blob/master/img/South-Gardens-Fact-Sheet-CIHK.pdf) shows 
that it partners with solicitors ['Riseam 
Sharples'](http://www.riseamsharples.com/legal-services/overseas-property-exhibitions), 
who attend Colliers' overseas sales launches.

Riseam Sharples began travelling to Hong Kong and Singapore in the 80s and 90s 
with the aim of helping [_'offshore investors to get a 
bargain'_](http://www.riseamsharples.com/legal-services/overseas-property-exhibitions). 
Riseam Sharples also has a commendable policy of registering clients' purchases 
with the Land Registry, even though such registration is not required or 
normally effected until the development is completed. The 46 buyers are 
Registered in the [Land Registry 
deeds](https://github.com/35percent/35percent.github.io/blob/master/img/LRegisterSouthGardens.pdf) as 
at Riseam Sharples HQ (2 Tower St, WC2H 9NP):

## Total Gain International
While one of the Colliers buyers listed in the [Land Registry 
deeds](/img/LRegisterSouthGardens.pdf) is clearly an asset management company, 
appropriately called ['Total Gain International 
Limited'](https://www.hkgbusiness.com/en/company/Total-Gain-International-Limited), 
we cannot categorically state that the remaining 45 buyers are also investors, 
but a google search brings up possible links to the following companies:

## Assets not homes
Leaving all this aside, there is no doubt that these properties are being 
marketed as investment assets - not homes. This is clear from the sales 
information that Lendlease supplies to potential buyers. They very helpfully 
estimate that the cheapest of the remaining flats at South Garden Point will 
earn you a healthy rental income of £22,360 per year. So if you have got £430 
per week to spare and need a 1-bed flat, head for South Garden Point.

*Lendlease's [price list](/img/Availability_1_bedrooms_WC_South_Gardens.pdf) 
for South Gardens*

## The other side of the coin - affordable housing
What about the affordable housing at South Gardens? The [Evening Standard 
article](/img/standard26102016.pdf) argued that while 2-beds in [Elephant 
Park](http://elephantpark.co.uk) might be selling for £1m, locals could 
nonetheless pick up an 'affordable' shared ownership flat for just £111,250 
(for a 25% share of a 1-bed).  

If the Standard had looked at the small print of the [price 
list](https://lqpricedin.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Elephant-park-1-bed-October16.pdf), 
they would have seen that out of total 360 homes in ['South 
Gardens'](http://www.elephantpark.co.uk/elephant-park/explore-the-development/south-garden)
only twenty five were available for shared ownership and only 7 were still 
available[^1]. The same small print in the [price 
list](https://lqpricedin.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Elephant-park-1-bed-October16.pdf) 
also shows that a minimum deposit of £30k is required and a minimum income of 
£42,918. We can assure the Evening Standard that there are not many at the 
Elephant and Castle who will be _'reviving the dream of home ownership'_ at 
these prices.

## Gentrification by the numbers
The Heygate redevelopment isn't an exception at the Elephant and Castle 
- out of 5000 new homes in the six major schemes barely 80 are social rented - 
  nor is it an exception for London, as the [LTF 
figures](http://35percent.org/img/LTF_delivery_of_housing_in_London_2014-15.pdf) 
show.

|__Development__| __Total homes__  | __Social rented__ |
|---|---|---|
| Heygate  | 2704  | 82  |
| Strata Tower  | 408  | 0  |
| One the Elephant  | 284  | 0  |
| Tribeca Square | 640 | 0 |
| Eileen House | 335 | 0 |
| London 360 Tower | 457 | 0 |
| __Total:__ | __4828__ | __82__ |

So it is not the populist narrative that is false as Dave Hill suggests, it is 
the deluded pro-gentrification narrative, which suffers from two 
misapprehensions; that affordable housing is actually affordable and that 
developers are actually building it.
