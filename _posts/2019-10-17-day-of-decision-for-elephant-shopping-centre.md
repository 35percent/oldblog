## Legal challenge goes to court next week

The legal battle to quash the planning permission for the demolition and redevelopment of the shopping centre reaches the High Court next week, when a judicial review hearing is scheduled for the 22 and 23 October.  The challenge is supported by the Up the Elephant campaign, the Public Interest Law Centre and Southwark Law Centre, as well as by the 35% Campaign. Our case will be presented by barristers Sarah Sackman of Francis Taylor Building and David Wolfe QC of Matrix Chambers.

The High Court will decide whether or not the Southwark Council's decision to award the permission to developer and shopping centre owner Delancey was lawful.  Delancey proposes to build shops, homes and much else besides, including a new Nothern Line tude entrance and new college campus for the London College of Communication.  But Delancey's big plans have very little in them for local people, those who live and work at the Elephant now.

If the shopping centre is demolished it will displace all the current traders. The demolition will also destroy a social hub for London's Latin American community and other ethnic groups and nowhere near enough has been done to mitigate the consequences of this. Latin American charity and advocates Latin Elephant/Petit Elephant have made a detailed study of what is happening to the traders; they estimate that almost 50 have not been allocated relocation space and have nowhere to go.

## We are losing not gaining

While we are losing the small traders from all over the world who have made the Elephant their home, Delancey's 'mixed-use' development we the one kind of housing we need most - social rented housing.  The Up the Elephant campaign has gradually driven up the social housing offer from 33 'social rent equivalent' to 116 proper social rent or council homes, but this is still a very small number out of of prented homes from zero to 116   
We are arguing that Southwark's Council’s planning committee was misled about the maximum amount of affordable housing the scheme could viably provide. Delancey said it could only afford to provide 116 social rented homes, but we now know that with Mayor’s funding they could give us another 42.

Even the 116 social rented homes promised could be at risk; the devil is in the detail and Delancey has managed to pull the wool over the Council's eyes with a deal which could leave us with little or no social rented housing if Delancey doesn’t deliver the “West site”, not due to be built for another 10 years.
