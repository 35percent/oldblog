## Legal challenge goes to court next week

The legal battle to quash the planning permission for the redevelopment of the shopping centre reaches the High Court next week, when a judicial review hearing is scheduled for the 22 and 23 of Oct.  The court will decide whether or not the Southwark Council's decision to award shopping centre owner and developer Delancey ward was lawful.  The challenge is supported by the Up the Elephant campaign, a coalition of local people and groups, including the 35% Campaign, fighting for a fairer regeneration at the Elephant and Castle.  Southwark Law Centre and the Public Interest Law Centre are acting for the campaign, which will be represented in court the David Wolf QC, of Matrix Cahmbers and Sarah Sackman, of the Francis Taylor   

The regeneration has already lost us over a thousand council homes, from the Elephant’s demolished Heygate estate, a scandal in a borough with desperate housing need. Now, shopping centre owner and property developer Delancey has won permission to demolish our local shopping centre.  They also have permission to build new shops and nearly a thousand homes, but only 116, at best, will be social rented – and we will have to wait nearly ten years to get them.

Southwark's Council’s planning committee was misled as to the maximum amount of affordable housing the scheme could viably provide. While Delancey said it could only afford to provide 116 social rented units we now know that with Mayor’s funding they could give us another 42. That’s 42 families deprived of somewhere decent and affordable to live.

Even the 116 social rented homes promised could be at risk; the devil is in the detail and Delancey has managed to pull the wool over the Council's eyes with a deal which could leave us with little or no social rented housing if Delancey doesn’t deliver the “West site”, not due to be built for another 10 years.

We are challenging Delancey’s planning permission through the Planning Court.  We want the permission quashed and then we want a development scheme that provides homes and shops that are truly affordable for local people.

Our legal challenge is supported by the Public Interest Law Centre and Southwark Law Centre.  We will be represented by barristers Sarah Sackman of Francis Taylor Building and David Wolfe QC of Matrix Chambers.

But we must raise at least £5000 to be able to mount this vital challenge and for that we need your help. All funds will go towards the legal costs of the case. If we lose the case we will have to pay the other side's costs. If we win, we will be able to pay our own lawyers!
