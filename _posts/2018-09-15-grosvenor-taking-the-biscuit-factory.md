# 1300 new homes, no social rented#
While most eyes have been on [developer Delancey's plans](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=externalDocuments&keyVal=_STHWR_DCAPR_9569810) for the redevelopment of the Elephant and Castle shopping centre, on the other side of Southwark an equally large, but worse proposal, for over a thousand homes without any social housing, has been stealthily making its way towards planning permission.

Grosvesnor Estates bought the Biscuit Factory and campus site in Bermondsey in 2013.  The site combines the former homes of biscuit manufacturer Peek Freans and the Bermondsey campus of Lewisham and Southwark FE College.  Peek Freans closed in 1989, the college left in 2013 and the site is currently occupied by a variety of businesses and offices.

Grosvenor proposes [a mixed use development](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=externalDocuments&keyVal=_STHWR_DCAPR_9575486) of 1343 new homes with 21000 sqm of other uses, and a new school.  The homes will all be Build to Rent (BtR), owned and managed by Grovesnor; none of the homes will be for sale.  Grosvesnor are offering 27% affordable housing at 75% market rents.  There will be no social rented housing or 'social rent equivalent' affordable housing. 

Southwark Council's adopted housing policy does not support BtR.  The housing policy for this part of Bermonndsey requires 35% affordable housing, 70% of which should be social rent.  This would amount to around 470 affordable units in total, 330 of which should be social rent.  Policy also requires that the remainder of the affordable housing be part-buty/part-rent. By contrast, the affordable housing in Build to Rent is a form of the egregious affordable rent, at up to 80% market rent.  Since 2011 Southwark have maintained that affordable rent  
[does not meet the borough's housing needs](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s24907/Report%20Clarification%20of%20affordable%20housing%20policies.pdf), but it is now in the middle of a sharp policy u-turn, which proposes allowing affordable rent (called Discounted Market Rent) in the latest version of the local plan, the [New Southwark Plan (NSP)](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/assets/attach/5811/NSP%20PSV%20FINAL.pdf) (see policy P4).  Grosvenor are taking advantage of the situation and are employing the same tactic as Delancey, by relying on this so-called 'emerging' policy, rather than the policy as it stands, to get their BtR application through planning committee.  The [London Plan](https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/planning/london-plan/minor-alterations-london-plan/minor-alterations-london-plan-2015#), [Sadiq Kahn's draft housing strategy 2016](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/2017_london_draft_housing_strategy.pdf) 
and the government's 
[White Paper](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/590463/Fixing_our_broken_housing_market_-_accessible_version.pdf) also provide welcome encouragement to impatient BtR developers.

Even if 'emerging' policy were applied to allow a BtR development, Grosvenor's affordable housing offer still comprehensively fails to fulfill its demands.  The NSP Policy P4 for BtR requires 35% total affordable housing, made up 12% 'social rent equivalent', 18% London Living Rent, 5% for £60k-£90k incomes.  Grosvenor falls short on every measure -  0% social rent equivalent, 0% London Living Rent, 100% at £60k-£90k market rent, and only 27% total affordable housing.

Other areas where Grosvenor's scheme fails policy tests are the
[number of studio flats](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!%2bn6U3QMQULFPWhUK7W10pA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) - (150; there should be no more than about 70 (5%), according to Southwark's [Core Strategy](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/assets/attach/1675/1.0.2%20DL%20Core_Strategy_2011.pdf)) and the length of covenant keeping the BtR units as rented tenure (a 15 year covenant is offered, [emerging policy](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/assets/attach/5811/NSP%20PSV%20FINAL.pdf) requires thirty years). [Management and lettings of affordable housing](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!6Xs2JaFpJu%2bk1WP4RoXHyA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) also appears to be a problem. Grosvenor makes no mention of using a registered provider, a Core Strategy requirement and is evidently reluctant to extend tenant nominations to Southwark.  [Grosvenor stresses](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!6Xs2JaFpJu%2bk1WP4RoXHyA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) that while _'it will work with LBS to enable prospective tenants to be sourced from any such list'_ (ie Southwark's intermediate housing)..._The lettings and nominations arrangements will need to recognise
that Grosvenor will need ultimate control over the occupation and management of the Proposed Development_'.

# Estimated profit of £99m not enough

As always the lack of affordable housing is justified by viability and it is no surprise to see that the viability assessment had been drafted by [DS2](http://www.ds2.co.uk/), who did [the same job for Delancey's](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!%2bUkiUaYFcVYqks74FHgXHA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) shopping centre development.  In  keeping with Southwark's [development viability policy](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/assets/attach/1807/Development_Viability_SPD_March_2016.pdf) we won't get to see the full assessment until a week before it goes to planning committee, and have to rely on an executive summary for any idea of the scheme's finances. The executive summary is deficient, policy wise in several respects; the construction, acquisition and other development costs and professional fees are lumped into one figure, instead of given seperately. The developer profit is given as an obscure percentage (7% IRR- Internal Rate of Return), not as a readlily understandable cash figure. Despite the obscurity, we can estimate the profit at 7% IRR as £99m, by subtracting costs from the gross development value. This is not  enough for Grosvenor, who reckon a _'reasonable benchmark'_ is 12% IRR and they _'therefore cannot afford to deliver any affordable housing'_.

![](http://35percent.org/img/grosvenorfva.png)

Grosvenor also claim that there can be no affordable housing, because of a list of other benefits the scheme provides, including 'the delivery of a new school'; why is not clear because elsewhere it states _'the construction of the new school is anticipated to be funded by the ESFA_ (Education and Skills Funding Agency)'

All is not lost though, because generous Grosvenor continue _'notwithstanding the overall scheme viability, it would be willing to offer 27.5% affordable housing, delivered as discount market rented (“DMR”) homes (“Grosvenor’s Offer”)_.'  The average discount would be 25% ie 75% market rents,  close to the maximum of 80% allowed for the egregious 'affordable rent'.  Exactly how much this will be we are left to guess - unlike Delancey's proposals for the shopping centre Grosvenor does not bother to provide any rent tables for either the market or affordable housing.  Currnet market rents  in the [SE16 postcode ](https://www.zoopla.co.uk/to-rent/flats/london/se16/rotherhithe-south-bermonsey-surrey-docks/) are upwards of £1600pcm.

        <label for="message">Comment:</label>
        <textarea name="message" id="message" cols="55" rows="10">Dear Southwark Planning,

I am writing to object to the revised planning application for the redevelopment of the shopping centre and LCC campus at the Elephant & Castle (ref:16/AP/4458).

Affordable Housing:
This application does not propose a policy compliant affordable housing mix. Southwark's policy for the Elephant & Castle requires a minimum of 35% affordable housing, of which 50% must be social rented. This should provide around 170 units but Delancey is proposing a different tenure and only 33 (3%) of the total units will be at social rent levels.

Affordable retail & existing traders:
The Council's strategic planning framework requires a minimum 10% affordable retail for new developments. Paragraph 5.1.7 of the Council's local planning policy (E&C SPD), further requires a number of "affordable retail units which are made available to existing occupiers displaced by development", in order to "ensure that development opportunities provide opportunities for existing and future SME businesses". The applicant's proposals fail to meet this and the Council's minimum 10% affordable retail requirement.

Bingo Hall:
Delancey is failing to make re-provision for the existing bingo hall. This is an importsnt social and community facility for 500 local pensioners every day. This important facility must be retained in any new development in order to ensure that community benefits are not lost without being replaced.

This application should not be considered by the Council until the above shortcomings have been addressed. 

Yours sincerely,
</textarea>
