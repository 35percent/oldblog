# 1200 new homes, no social rented#
While most eyes have been on [developer Delancey's plans](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=externalDocuments&keyVal=_STHWR_DCAPR_9569810) for the redevelopment of the Elephant and Castle shopping centre, on the other side of Southwark, an equally large, but worse proposal, for over a thousand homes with no social housing, has been stealthily making its way towards planning permission.

Grovesnor Estates bought the Biscuit Factory and campus site in Bermondsey in 2013.  The site combines the the former homes of biscuit manufacturer Peek Freans and the Bermondsey campus of Lewisham and Southwark FE College.  Peek Freans closed in 1989, the college left in 2013 and the site is currently occupied by a variety of businesses and offices.

Grosvenor proposes [a mixed use development](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=externalDocuments&keyVal=_STHWR_DCAPR_9575486) of 1217 new homes with 19000 sqm of other uses, and a new school (link).  The homes will all be Build to Rent (BtR), owned and mangaged by Grovesnor; none will be for sale.  Grovesnor are offering 27% affordable housing at 75% market rents.  There will be no social rented housing or 'social rent equivalent' affordable housing. 

Southwark Council's adopted housing policy does not support BtR.  The housing policy for this part of Bermonndsey and requires 35% affordable housing, three-quarters of which should be social rent.  This would amount to around 420 affordable units in total, 360 of which should be social rent.  Policy also requires that the remainder of the affordable housing be part-buty/part-rent. By contrast, the affordable housing in Build to Rent is a form of the egregious affordable rent, at up to 80% market rent.  Southwark have maintained since 2011 that this 
[does not meet the borough's housing needs](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s24907/Report%20Clarification%20of%20affordable%20housing%20policies.pdf), but is in the middle of a sharp policy u-turn, which proposes allowing affordable rent (called Discounted Market Rent) in the latest version of the local plan, the [New Southwark Plan](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/assets/attach/5811/NSP%20PSV%20FINAL.pdf) (see policy P4).  Grovesnor are employing the same tactic as Delancey and relying on this so-called 'emerging' policy, rather than the policy as it stands, to get their application through planning committee.

# Estimated profit £900m

It is no surprise to see that the viability assessment had been drafted by DS2, wo did the same job for Delancey's shopping centre development (link).  In  keeping with Southwark's viability and development policy (link) we won't get to see the full assessment until a week before it goes to planning committee, and have to rely on an executive summary for any idea of the scheme's finances. The executive summary is deficient, policy wise in several respects; the construction, acquisition and other development costs and professional fees are lumped into one figure, instead of given seperately. The developer profit is given as an obscure percentage (7% IRR- Internal Rate of Return), not as a readlily understandable cash figure.  A simple calculation,though, subtracting costs from the gross development value, does allow to estimate the profit at £99m.  This is not enough for Grovesnor though, who reckon the profit does not meet the industry standard (12% IRR) and so cannot provide the full quota of affordable housing.  Grovesnor claim  27% affordable is all there can be, and at 75% market rents, they will be close to the maximum of 80% allowed for the egregious 'affordable rent'.  Exactly how much this will be we are left to guess - unlike Delancey's proposals for the shopping centre Grovesnor does not bother to provide any rent tables for either the market or affordable housing.  Currnet market rents are upwards of £1600pcm in the [SE16 postcode ](https://www.zoopla.co.uk/to-rent/flats/london/se16/rotherhithe-south-bermonsey-surrey-docks/).

        <textarea name="message" id="message" cols="55" rows="10">Dear Southwark Planning,

I am writing to object to the revised planning application for the redevelopment of the shopping centre and LCC campus at the Elephant & Castle (ref:16/AP/4458).

Affordable Housing:
This application does not propose a policy compliant affordable housing mix. Southwark's policy for the Elephant & Castle requires a minimum of 35% affordable housing, of which 50% must be social rented. This should provide around 170 units but Delancey is proposing a different tenure and only 33 (3%) of the total units will be at social rent levels.

Affordable retail & existing traders:
The Council's strategic planning framework requires a minimum 10% affordable retail for new developments. Paragraph 5.1.7 of the Council's local planning policy (E&C SPD), further requires a number of "affordable retail units which are made available to existing occupiers displaced by development", in order to "ensure that development opportunities provide opportunities for existing and future SME businesses". The applicant's proposals fail to meet this and the Council's minimum 10% affordable retail requirement.

Bingo Hall:
Delancey is failing to make re-provision for the existing bingo hall. This is an importsnt social and community facility for 500 local pensioners every day. This important facility must be retained in any new development in order to ensure that community benefits are not lost without being replaced.

This application should not be considered by the Council until the above shortcomings have been addressed. 

Yours sincerely,
</textarea>
