# 1200 new homes, no social rented#
While most eyes have been on the plans for the redevelopment of the Elephant and Castle shopping centre, an equally large and very similiar proposal, with no social rented housing, out of over a thousand new homes, on the other side of Southwark has been stealthily making its way towards planning permission.

The Biscuit Factory in Bermondsey is the former site of Peek Freans, which employed xxx workers in its heyday.  It closed in 1989 and is now the home to a variety of businesses and offices.  The site was bought by Grovesnor Estates (?) in 2013.  Grosvenor proposes a mixed use development of 1217 new homes with 19000 sqm of other uses, and a new school.  The homes will all be Build to Rent, owned and mangaged by Grovesnor; none will be for sale.  Grovesnor are offering 27% affordable housing at 75% market rents.  There will be no social rented housing. 

The housing policy for the area requires 35% affordable housing, three-quarters of which social rent.  This would amount to around 420 affordable units in total, 360 of which social rent. Southwark has no current policy which allows BtR.  Grovesnor are relying on so-called 'emerging about 450 units, with the remainder .  Policy also requires

Convenant 15 years

        <textarea name="message" id="message" cols="55" rows="10">Dear Southwark Planning,

I am writing to object to the revised planning application for the redevelopment of the shopping centre and LCC campus at the Elephant & Castle (ref:16/AP/4458).

Affordable Housing:
This application does not propose a policy compliant affordable housing mix. Southwark's policy for the Elephant & Castle requires a minimum of 35% affordable housing, of which 50% must be social rented. This should provide around 170 units but Delancey is proposing a different tenure and only 33 (3%) of the total units will be at social rent levels.

Affordable retail & existing traders:
The Council's strategic planning framework requires a minimum 10% affordable retail for new developments. Paragraph 5.1.7 of the Council's local planning policy (E&C SPD), further requires a number of "affordable retail units which are made available to existing occupiers displaced by development", in order to "ensure that development opportunities provide opportunities for existing and future SME businesses". The applicant's proposals fail to meet this and the Council's minimum 10% affordable retail requirement.

Bingo Hall:
Delancey is failing to make re-provision for the existing bingo hall. This is an importsnt social and community facility for 500 local pensioners every day. This important facility must be retained in any new development in order to ensure that community benefits are not lost without being replaced.

This application should not be considered by the Council until the above shortcomings have been addressed. 

Yours sincerely,
</textarea>
