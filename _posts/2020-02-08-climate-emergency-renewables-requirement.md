Having recently [declared](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/news/2019/apr/southwark-council-declares-climate-change-emergency) a climate emergency, last week the Council's head of planning and Cabinet member for Climate Emergency [wrote](https://twitter.com/Livingstone_RJ/status/1225512725448622081) to the Government complaining that its [stricter building regulations emissions requirements](https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/move-to-change-the-regs-to-slash-emissions-in-all-new-housing/10044639.article) will impede its ability to set its own policy requirements.

On Saturday, Southwark is [hosting a 'Climate Emergency Conference'](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/engagement-and-consultations/empowering-communities/community-conference) so that residents can _"find out what the Council is doing to tackle the climate emergency"_ and _"play a part in Southwark becoming carbon neutral by 2030"_:

It's all very well residents playing their part, but, given that Carbonemissions from Londonâ€™s homes and work places make up 78 per cent of emissions[^1] what about developers playing their part?

The Council's [current policy](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/assets/attach/1820/Sustainable_Design_and_Construction_SPD.pdf) requires all new developments to provide at least 20% of their energy consumption using on-site renewable technology:

This is mirrored by the Mayor's minimum 20% policy requirement in the London Plan(ref). The Mayor has made a big deal about climate change and has [vowed to make London carbon neutral by 2030 if re-elected.](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/17/sadiq-khan-vows-to-make-london-carbon-neutral-by-2030-if-re-elected-mayor)

Not even the Council's own schemes on public land where it is a development partner has the Council bothered to comply with its own policy requirements - see Heygate/Wood Dene/Aylesbury/Elmington, Canada Water. 

Cllr Livingstone's letter also complains that the government's new policy is silent on embodied carbon - perhaps a sore point for a council which has knocked down 8,000 homes in its council estate [renewal programme](http://35percent.org/great-estates).
