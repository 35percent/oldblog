Without consultation, Southwark Council has decided to scrap the 182-page planning document which sets the parameters for its redevelopment of the Aylesbury estate. It will instead be replaced by a [5-page 'site allocation'](img/nsp-aylesbury-background-paper-12-april-2021.pdf) (see paras 11-13) as part of the [New Southwark Plan](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning-policy-and-transport-policy/new-southwark-plan) and 1-page 'Area Vision'.

The implications of this are significant; while Southwark claim that all the relevant policies in the [Aylesbury Area Action Plan](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning-policy-and-transport-policy/development-plan/area-action-plans-section/aylesbury-aap)  will be taken into account by the NSP, to ensure that such things as the more generous space standards, more family housing and car-parking for residents are retained, and that there will be no 'policy gap' the AAAP set out a number of requirements, which will not be carried across into the New Southwark Plan, meaning that they have now effectively been dropped.

## Zero Carbon Growth

Policy 3.6.1 of the AAAP required the scheme to result in 'zero carbon growth':

*"The development will be designed to result in zero carbon growth, that is,no net growth in carbon dioxide emissions despite an increase in the number of dwellings. This will require buildings which are highly energy efficient."*

The New Southwark Plan policies for the Aylesbury make no reference to the scheme's carbon growth requirements.

## Open Space

Policy 4.5.1 of the AAAP requires that the Aylesbury redevelopment results in no net loss of open space. The New Southwark Plan policies make no reference to open space requirements for the redeveloped Aylesbury.

Paragraph A6.5.7 of the AAAP envisaged the replacement open space to come in the form of a series of 'green fingers' - *"multi-functional spaces that link with Burgess Park" :"A series of ‘green fingers’ will be created, extending from Burgess Park into the action area core interlinking the park with the development. Their predominant function is that of a public space with social interaction, pedestrian and cycle movement dominating."*

The New Southwark Plan policies make no reference to open space requirements for the redeveloped Aylesbury or to the green fingers.

## Childrens' Play/Youth Space

Paragraph 3.6.2 of the AAAP says: *"We will require children’s play areas to be integrated into the residential areas. About 3 hectares of children’s play space and youth space will be provided".*

The generous allocation that the AAAP made to play and youth space was designed to reflect the fact that the Aylesbury estate itself is designed around an extensive network of children's and youth play spaces.

The proposed New Southwark Plan makes no requirement to replace any of the children's play and youth space.

## Family homes

The Aylesbury estate contains a high proportion of family homes; over a third of the homes on the estate are 3 beds or larger. Because of this the AAAP set out to ensure that this proportion is maintained, further adding that: *"Increasing the proportion of homes suitable for families was a key concern which local residents raised during consultation.” (para 3.5.3)"*

The proposed dwelling mix schedule on pages 106 and 107 of the AAAP said that 1,315 of the 4,200 new homes on the estate would be 3-bed family homes or larger.

The proposed New Southwark Plan says that just 20% of the new homes need to be 3-bed or larger.

## Replacement Social Housing

The AAAP committed to replacing all of the social rented housing on the Aylesbury estate (para 3.3.1 of the AAAP).

In 2019, Southwark [announced](https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/aylesbury-regen-increase-in-social-rent-housing-in-phase-2-means-all-tenants-from-later-development-stages-will-have-off-plan-homes-ready-by-2028/) in a [Cabinet report](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s81088/Report%20Aylesbury%20Regeneration%20Programme%20Moving%20Forward.pdf) that it plans to increase the number of new homes in order to ensure that there is no net loss of social rented housing. 

While the New Southwark Plan indicates that *"it would now be appropriate to consider an increased number of homes for  the  Aylesbury  area within  the  land  covered  by  the  Area  Action  Plan  boundary,  with  a  view  to moving towards replacing  all  the  existing  social  rented  homes"*, it falls short of making a commitment either to increasing the density or ensuring no net loss. 

## End of service life?

In its proposed New Southwark Plan Southwark describes the Aylesbury estate as *"characterised by large concrete slab buildings built in the mid 1960s –70s, now at the end of their service life."*

This caused some controversy among estate residents, some of which [made objections during the plan's examination in public last Tuesday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3CohnTQXhI). They argued that the Council has submitted no evidence base supporting this claim and has failed to investigate whether refurbisment could be a more viable option, especially given Southwark's recent decision [to bail out](http://35percent.org/2020-07-12-aylesbury-estate-fds-variation/) its development partner Notting Hill housing by allocating a further £200m, after the housing association was [hit with financial problems](https://www.insidehousing.co.uk/news/news/notting-hill-genesis-scales-back-development-plans-amid-changing-market-conditions-62506). 

Successful examples of the refurbishment of estates built using the same system as the Aylesbury can be found on the [Six Acres estate](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/OCD28_SixAcresestateRefurb_Illustrations.pdf) in Islington and the [Doddington estate](/img/doddington.pdf) in Battersea.

## Aylesbury - part of the problem, not the solution

The loss of the AAAP also allows Southwark to gloss over the dismally slow pace of the redevelopment.  While various community facilities, including the the Michael Faraday school, have been completed, the house building programme has fallen many years behind schedule.  According to the AAAP’s timetable over 2,500 new homes should have been built by now (Table A7.1), at an average rate of 221 homes per year; in fact, only 408 have been completed, giving a rate on only 40 homes per year.

These figures also take no account of the homes lost through demolition.  When this is factored in the situation is even worse.  ‘Net’ building, that is homes above the number knocked-down, will not start arriving until 2022/23, when 122 net homes are expected.  There will be a further 276 in 23/24, with the remaining 1,102 to be completed between 2025-2035 (Appendix 2: Sites Methodology Report April 2021).

These issues were forcefully raised by local campaigners and residents at [the EiP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3CohnTQXhI).  They questioned whether Notting Hill Genesis (NHG), the developer of the site, was actually capable of delivering the development, pointing out that NHG had been the subject of a [regulatory warning last year](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-judgement-notting-hill-genesis/previous-regulatory-judgement-notting-hill-genesis-31-july-2019), prompting Southwark [to bail them out](https://www.35percent.org/2020-07-12-aylesbury-estate-fds-variation/) and take over the First Development Site itself.

Campaigners also cast some doubt on whether a large net gain in housing would ever be achieved, without which the huge displacement and disruption of the whole regeneration can barely be justified. The additional pressure on the housing waiting list of rehousing displaced tenants was also noted. 

Campaigners argued, that given these circumstances,, and not forgetting the climate emergency (link Southwark’s commitment), there would need to be changes to the planning permission granted to NHG and the agreement it has with Southwark for delivering the development. 

## A puzzle

There is also a mystery as to how Southwark will fulfill its new commitment to replacing the 2,249 social rented units.  While making this commitment in the NSP, Southwark also insisted in the public examination that the AAAP numbers for housing and tenure mix will remain the same. The problem with this is that Notting Hill Genesis’s planning permission depends on these numbers and these allow for a loss of social rented units of anything between 237 and 778 social rented units, (as does the legal agreement for the development between Southwark and NHG).  Southwark acknowledged if there was a significant change in the numbers, that there would have to be a new planning permission, but that was not envisaged.

The answer to this might be that Southwark pay NHG for the site and take over the permission themselves, as they [did on the FDS](https://www.35percent.org/2020-07-12-aylesbury-estate-fds-variation/), converting units to social rent; this, though, would be a big drain on its housing revenue account (HRA), depriving Southwark of funds to spend on social housing elsewhere in the borough.

## The time has come for a rethink....

The [Aylesbury Area Action Plan](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning-policy-and-transport-policy/development-plan/area-action-plans-section/aylesbury-aap) (AAAP) was adopted 10 years ago following lengthy consultation and was supposed to govern the 20-year redevelopment of the estate.

Area Action Plans are special planning policy documents which are required when an undergoes extensive redevelopment. They require a high level of consulation and involvement of residents affected and are subject to an independent Examination in Public.

Southwark should not be rescinding this important planning policy document half way through the estate's redevelopment without first carrying out a full public consultation and ensuring that the key policies are carried across to the proposed New Southwark Plan.

Not behind closed doors....
