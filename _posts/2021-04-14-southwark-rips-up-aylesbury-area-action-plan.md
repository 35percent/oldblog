Without consultation, Southwark Council has decided to scrap the 182-page planning document which sets the parameters for its redevelopment of the Aylesbury estate. The so-called Aylesbury Area Action Plan (AAAP) will instead be replaced by a [5-page 'site allocation'](img/nsp-aylesbury-background-paper-12-april-2021.pdf) (see paras 11-13)and a two-page 'Area Vision', as part of the [New Southwark Plan](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning-policy-and-transport-policy/new-southwark-plan) .

The decision was revealed in a [late background paper](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/assets/attach/38832/EIP202a-Aylesbury-Background-Paper-Update-20042021.pdf) for the Examination in Public  of the New Southwark Plan (NSP).  Described by the government Inspector at the [Examination in Public (EIP)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3CohnTQXhI) as a ‘raft of policies’, the AAAP incorporated [29 policy documents](https://digital-land.github.io/development-plan-document/local-authority-eng/SWK/dev-plan-aaap-2010/#record), covering all aspects of the redevelopment, including housing, design, open space and the phasing of the development.  It was adopted as the effective rule-book for the redevelopment of the estate in 2010, after several years of extensive public consultation, including its own separate public examination.

The implications of this are significant; while Southwark claim that all the relevant policies in the [AAAP](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning-policy-and-transport-policy/development-plan/area-action-plans-section/aylesbury-aap) will be taken into account by the NSP, so that such things as more generous space standards, more family housing and car-parking for residents are retained, the lack of any prior notice or consultation has raised strong fears that much that was beneficial in the AAAP will not be carried across into the New Southwark Plan.

## Zero Carbon Growth

Amongst the AAAP policies, Policy 3.6.1 requires the scheme to result in 'zero carbon growth':

*"The development will be designed to result in zero carbon growth, that is, no net growth in carbon dioxide emissions despite an increase in the number of dwellings. This will require buildings which are highly energy efficient."*

While the NSP requires developers to take measures towards achieving carbon neutrality, and has targets for major developments (Policy P69), the very specific requirement that the Aylesbury achieves zero carbon growth will be lost.

Experience has shown that unless such a requirements is exact and explicit, as it is for the Aylesbury, it can be lost when complicated, large schemes are considered for planning approval and the decision is made by balancing out how well the development meets all planning requirements, not just environmental requirements. 

## Open Space

Policy 4.5.1 of the AAAP requires that the Aylesbury redevelopment results in no net loss of open space. Again, while the NSP has the strategic target for the borough, to retain and protect all open space, it makes no specific reference to open space requirements for the redeveloped Aylesbury.

This is a particular concern, given Southwark's welcome new commitment to re-provide all the social housing on the new development, which could put space at a premium.  The NSP also allows payments in lieu of providing open space, a get-out that is often used by developers who want to build to maximum density.

Paragraph A6.5.7 of the AAAP also envisaged the replacement open space to come in the form of a series of 'green fingers' - *"multi-functional spaces that link with Burgess Park" :"A series of ‘green fingers’ will be created, extending from Burgess Park into the action area core interlinking the park with the development. Their predominant function is that of a public space with social interaction, pedestrian and cycle movement dominating."*

The NSP makes no reference to the green fingers.

## Childrens' Play/Youth Space

 Paragraph 3.6.2 of the AAAP says: *"We will require children’s play areas to be integrated into the residential areas. About 3 hectares of children’s play space and youth space will be provided".*

The proposed New Southwark Plan makes no requirement to replace any of the children's play and youth space.

Campaigners and residents giving evidence at the EIP also pointed out that there were three separate policies for play space and open space in the AAAP (PL5, PL6, PL7), and that they provided space well beyond that which was standard.  This generous allocation of space in the AAAP reflects the estate's design, around an extensive network of children's and youth play spaces.  Campaigners noted that this was part of the family orientation of the AAAP, and that these policies would need equal prominence in the NSP, to make sure that families remained a priority in the redevelopment.

## Replacement Social Housing

In March 2019, Southwark [announced](https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/aylesbury-regen-increase-in-social-rent-housing-in-phase-2-means-all-tenants-from-later-development-stages-will-have-off-plan-homes-ready-by-2028/) in a [Cabinet report](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s81088/Report%20Aylesbury%20Regeneration%20Programme%20Moving%20Forward.pdf) an *'important shift'* in its plans for the Aylesbury, with the *'ambition... to see the replacement of the number of social rented homes on the footprint of the estate'.*  This welcome change would be helped by an increase in density on Phase 2 of the site, increasing the number of homes by nearly 400 units, to 1,250 in total.  

The New Southwark Plan follows through on this, saying that *"it would now be appropriate to consider an increased number of homes within  the  land  covered  by  the Action Area Core, replacing  all  the  existing  social  rented  homes within the footprint of the estate".*  

## End of service life?

In its proposed New Southwark Plan Southwark describes the Aylesbury estate as *"characterised by large concrete slab buildings built in the mid 1960s –70s, now at the end of their service life."*

This caused some controversy among estate residents, some of which [made objections during the plan's examination in public last Tuesday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3CohnTQXhI). They argued that the Council has submitted no evidence base supporting this claim and has failed to investigate whether refurbisment could be a more viable option, especially given Southwark's recent decision [to bail out](http://35percent.org/2020-07-12-aylesbury-estate-fds-variation/) its development partner Notting Hill housing by allocating a further £200m, after the housing association was [hit with financial problems](https://www.insidehousing.co.uk/news/news/notting-hill-genesis-scales-back-development-plans-amid-changing-market-conditions-62506). 

Successful examples of the refurbishment of estates built using the same system as the Aylesbury can be found on the [Six Acres estate](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/OCD28_SixAcresestateRefurb_Illustrations.pdf) in Islington and the [Doddington estate](/img/doddington.pdf) in Battersea.

## Aylesbury - part of the problem, not the solution

The loss of the AAAP also allows Southwark to gloss over the dismally slow pace of the redevelopment.  While various community facilities have been completed, the house building programme has fallen many years behind schedule.  According to the AAAP’s timetable over 2,500 new homes should have been built by now (Table A7.1), at an average rate of 221 homes per year; in fact, only 408 have been completed, giving a rate on only 40 homes per year.

These figures also take no account of the homes lost through demolition.  When this is factored in the situation is even worse.  ‘Net’ building, that is homes above the number knocked-down, will not start arriving until 2022/23, when 122 net homes are expected.  There will be a further 276 in 23/24, with the remaining 1,102 to be completed between 2025-2035 (Appendix 2: Sites Methodology Report April 2021).

These issues were forcefully raised by local campaigners and residents at [the EiP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3CohnTQXhI).  They questioned whether Notting Hill Genesis (NHG), the developer of the site, was actually capable of delivering the development, pointing out that NHG had been the subject of a [regulatory warning last year](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-judgement-notting-hill-genesis/previous-regulatory-judgement-notting-hill-genesis-31-july-2019), prompting Southwark [to bail them out](https://www.35percent.org/2020-07-12-aylesbury-estate-fds-variation/) and take over the First Development Site itself.

Campaigners also cast some doubt on whether a large net gain in housing would ever be achieved, without which the huge displacement and disruption of the whole regeneration can barely be justified. The additional pressure on the housing waiting list of rehousing displaced tenants was also noted. 

Campaigners argued, that given these circumstances,, and not forgetting the climate emergency (link Southwark’s commitment), there would need to be changes to the planning permission granted to NHG and the agreement it has with Southwark for delivering the development. 

## A puzzle

Campaigners also There is also a mystery about how Southwark's welcome new commitment, to replace the Aylesbury's 2,249 social rented units, will be delivered, while Notting Hill Genesis’s planning permission allow for a loss of up to 778 social rented units.  Southwark acknowledged in the EIP that if there was a significant change in the housing numbers, then there would have to be a new planning permission, but that this was not envisaged. 

The answer to this might be that Southwark pay NHG for the site and take over the permission themselves, as they [did on the FDS](https://www.35percent.org/2020-07-12-aylesbury-estate-fds-variation/), converting free-market or intermediate units to social rent; this, though, would be a big drain on its housing revenue account (HRA), depriving Southwark of funds to spend on social housing elsewhere in the borough.

## The time has come for a rethink....

The [Aylesbury Area Action Plan](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning-policy-and-transport-policy/development-plan/area-action-plans-section/aylesbury-aap) (AAAP) was adopted 10 years ago following lengthy consultation and was supposed to govern the 20-year redevelopment of the estate.  

There are good reasons to update the AAAP (not least because it now comes into conflict with more recent planning policy documents) but Area Action Plans are special planning policy documents, for large, extensive redevelopments, such as the Aylesbury. They require a high level of consultation and involvement of residents affected and are subject to an independent Examination in Public.

Any proper consultation must also take into account the slow progress to date, the climate emergency and the impact of the redevelopment on the residents, the majority of whom are from black and ethnic minority backgrounds (a point forcefully made by long-term residents, past and present, in the EIP).

Should it 

Southwark should not be rescinding this important planning policy document half way through the estate's redevelopment without first carrying out a full public consultation and ensuring that the key policies are carried across to the proposed New Southwark Plan.

Not behind closed doors....
