Thanks to a blunder made by its ongoing gross incompetence, Southwark Council has accidentally published its legal agreement for the redevelopment of the Aylesbury estate.

The blunder came after an investigation by Information Commissioner ....

## What it didn't want us to know
First things that surprises us is that there is a third development partner - Barratt Homes. There has been no mention of this whatsoever in Council briefing papers..

Barratt is teaming up with NHHT to build all 17xx private homes on the redeveloped estate. Not only is Barratt building the homes but it is selling them. Southwark will supposedly get a 50% share of the 'overage' profit on private sales above £471 per square foot, but only after Barratt has taken a 5% sales fee and NHHT has taken a 21% priority return, plus a 2% management fee.

NHHT pays for demolition of the FDS (only?) but the costs are deducted from its £9m infrastructure fee for plot 18.
