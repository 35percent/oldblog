title: Elephant Shopping Centre - traders and campaigners step-up the fight
---

## Campaigners set to mount legal challenge

Elephant shopping Centre traders and local campaigners have taken the first step on a legal challenge to Southwark Council's [resolution to approve](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/mgAi.aspx?ID=49413) the [shopping centre planning application](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/simpleSearchResults.do?action=firstPage).  The [Public Interest Unit](http://www.pilu.org.uk/paul-heron/) of Lambeth Law Centre, sent a pre-action letter to Southwark, asking it to rescind the decision taken by the planning committee on 3 July 2018, or return the application to the committee.  If the Council fails to do this an application will be made to the [Planning Court](https://www.gov.uk/courts-tribunals/planning-court) to quash the decision. 

The PIU is acting on behalf of a claimant active in the [Up the Elephant](https://twitter.com/UpTheElephant_) campaign and [Southwark Defend Council Housing](https://www.facebook.com/southwarkdch/).  The campaign is supported by [Southwark Law Centre](http://www.southwarklawcentre.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=71&Itemid=78) and [Latin Elephant](http://latinelephant.org/).  Barrister [Sarah Sackman](https://www.ftbchambers.co.uk/barristers/sarah-sackman) of Francis Taylor Building has agreed to represent the campaign.

The seven page pre action letter gives two grounds for rescinding the permission. First, that the planning committee was misled about public funding for the social housing in the scheme. The committee depended on an officer's report in making its decision and this led it to believe that funding from the Greater London Authority [(GLA)](https://www.london.gov.uk/), was secured for an increase of social rented housing, when this was not the case.  The second ground is that Southwark had not fulfilled its publIc sector equality duty (PSED) properly, neglecting the collective impact on the Latin American community, for whom the [centre is a social and economic hub](http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/90160/).  Southwark had also not taken into account the impact on women business owners from black and ethnic minority backgrounds or on particular Latin American nationalities, such as Colombians, despite the detailed objections of [Latin Elephant](http://latinelephant.org/update-on-ec-relocation-strategy-le-comments/) and [Southwark Law Centre](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!%2b3vgsnFhgtxRNSSWoQ1w3w%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) The letter gives a deadline for reply of 24 Oct 2018 and this is still awaited.

## The Mayor to respond

Aside from the legal challange the Mayor Sadique Khan Mayor will also be having his say once the draft legal S106 agreement that would seal the planning approval is complet and campaigners have written an [open letter](https://twitter.com/UpTheElephant_) asking him to reject the approval as it stands. Local ward councillors [added their voice](https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/ward-councillors-call-on-sadiq-khan-to-fix-moral-and-policy-failings-in-approved-elephant-and-castle-regeneration-plans/) to the call as did assembley member[Sian Berry](www.southwarkgreenparty.org.uk/call_in_the_elephant_decision_says_sian).  Mayor Sadique Khan has himself said he is ['keen to ensure that it delivers as much genuinely affordable housing as possible'](https://www.insidehousing.co.uk/news/news/khan-keen-for-elephant--castle-development-to-deliver-affordable-housing-58462).


## Castle Square objections

Should the development survive any legal challenge or call-in from the Mayor, developers Delancey must provide a temporary facility for displaced independant traders as a condition of any planning approval.

They have duly lodged a planning application for this, but it is inadequate  proposals for this aLatin Elephant and the [Elephant Traders have objected to](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=neighbourComments&keyVal=_STHWR_DCAPR_9578882) have objected to the [planning application]() for temporary retail accommodation for traders displaced from the shopping centre, for a period of 5 years, until the Elephant & Castle Shopping Centre development has been completed. Traders would then have the first right of refusal back into the shopping centre.

The facility is being provided by the developers of the shopping centre Delancey as a [condition](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/mgAi.aspx?ID=49413) of the the shopping centre planning approval and would be on land owned by Southwark, but currently [leased to Delancy on a peppercorn rent](http://35percent.org/2016-06-26-restricted-access-elephant-park/) and a share of future revenue from the market.  The planning condition implies that Delancey will now be buying the land from Southwark.

The temporary facility is valuable gain for the traders, won by their campaign for a fair deal, but the proposed building is too small and would have trading restrictions that would make it an impractical alternative for many businesses.  The building is designed for 24 traders, [Delancey's  proposals]() mention 33 independent traders, while the trader's own estimate is that there is a need to provide for over a 100 traders. There are many other issues, including the level of rents and service charges, the security of tenacy arrangements, restrictions on opening hours would be charge,  

Delancey have agreed to the establishment of a Traders Panel and traders want these issues, and the size of the relocation fund, (currently at an insufficient Â£634,700) to be decided by the Panel, but trader representations on the remit and format of the Panel have gone unanswered.

## Delancey not there yet

Delancey only secured a resolution to approve their shopping centre application after three planning committee meetings.  It must now get a further planning permission for the trader's temporary facility on Castle Square, before they can undertake any shopping centre redevelopment.  We must ensure that the traders get the best possible deal whatever happens; they need the temporary facility, but it must be better, so, if you would like to help achieve this,  please submit the following objection - just click here. 


Objection

We welcome this proposed development as some mitigation to the detrimental impact of the redevelopment of the Elephant shopping centre on local independent traders.

However, the Applicant's proposals require changes if the development is to benefit the number of traders who need help.
We therefore support the comments and suggestions made by the Elephant Traders Association and Latin Elephant for improvements to the Applicant's proposals, and ask that before any planning permission is granted that

-	the size of the facility be increased to accommodate all the displaced independent traders who require new premises

and that the following should be agreed with the traders;

-	the rents and service charge levels
-	secure tenancy arrangements
-	selection criteria, should they be needed 
-	hours of trade
-	disability access
- 	remit and format of a Traders Panel that truly represents their interests
-	a sufficient relocation fund
