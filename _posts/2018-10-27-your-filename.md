## Campaigners set to mount legal challenge

Shopping Centre traders and campaigners have taken the first step towards a legal challenge of Southwark Council's approval of the shopping centre planning application.  The [Public Interest Unit](http://www.pilu.org.uk/paul-heron/) of Lambeth Law Centre, acting on behalf of the Up the Elephant campaign and Latin Elephant, sent a pre-action letter to Southwark, asking it to rescind the decision taken by the planning committee on xxxx, or return the application to the committee.  If the Council fails to do this campaigners and traders will apply to the High Court for an order to quash the decision.  The campaign is supported by Southwark Law Centre and barrister [Sarah Sackman](https://www.ftbchambers.co.uk/barristers/sarah-sackman) of Francis Taylor Building has agreed to represent the campaign.

The seven page letter gives two grounds for rescinding the permission. First, that the committee was misled about public funding for social housing. The report says that Mayoral funding, through the Greater London Authority, was secured for an increase of social rented housing from 74 to 116 units, when this was not the case.  Second, that Southwark had no properly fulfilled its publIc sector equality duty (PSED) properly, neglecting any measurement of the impact on Latin American natinals, such as Colombians.  The letter gives a deadline for reply of 24 Oct 2018 and this is still awaited.

## Castle Square objections

Should the development survive any leagal chaSeperately Latin Elephant and the [Elephant Traders have objected to](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=neighbourComments&keyVal=_STHWR_DCAPR_9578882) have objected to the [planning application]() for temporary retail accommodation for traders displaced from the shopping centre, for a period of 5 years, until the Elephant & Castle Shopping Centre development has been completed. Traders would then have the first right of refusal back into the shopping centre.

The facility is being provided by the developers of the shopping centre Delancey as a [condition](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/mgAi.aspx?ID=49413) of the the shopping centre planning approval and would be on land owned by Southwark, but currently [leased to Delancy on a peppercorn rent](http://35percent.org/2016-06-26-restricted-access-elephant-park/) and a share of future revenue from the market.  The planning condition implies that Delancey will now be buying the land from Southwark.

The temporary facility is valuable gain for the traders, won by their campaign for a fair deal, but the proposed building is too small and would have trading restrictions that would make it an impractical alternative for many businesses.  The building is designed for 24 traders, [Delancey's  proposals]() mention 33 independent traders, while the trader's own estimate is that there is a need to provide for over a 100 traders. There are many other issues, including the level of rents and service charges, the security of tenacy arrangements, restrictions on opening hours would be charge,  

Delancey have agreed to the establishment of a Traders Panel and traders want these issues to be decided by the Panel, but trader representations on the remit and format of the Panel have gone unanswered.

Should it survive any legal The development of th shopping centre cannot go ahead without the approval of the Castle Square temporary facility.  The 
Objection

We welcome this proposed development as some mitigation to the detrimental impact of the redevelopment of the Elephant shopping centre on local independent traders.

However, the Applicant's proposals require changes if the development is to benefit the number of traders who need help.
We therefore support the comments and suggestions made by the Elephant Traders Association and Latin Elephant for improvements to the proposals, and ask that before any planning permission is granted that

-	the size of the facility be increased to accommodate all the displaced independent traders who require new premises

and that the following should be agreed with the traders;

-	the rents and service charge levels
-	secure tenancy arrangements
-	selection criteria, should they be needed 
-	hours of trade
-	disability access
- 	remit and format of a Traders Panel that truly represents their interests
