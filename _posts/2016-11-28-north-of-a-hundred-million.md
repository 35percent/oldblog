Council leader Peter John has been grilled by Australian national broadcaster 
ABC, in an interview about the Heygate redevelopment.

The interview was part of the following [report by 
ABC](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-11-11/homes-for-profit-not-people./8019560), 
which was broadcast on australian television:

ABC reporter Steve Cannane also published his full 20min interview with Cllr 
John, in which he made a number of fanciful claims about the deal he signed 
with Australian developer Lendlease:

To anyone who has been following the Heygate saga, these claims would 
immediately suspicious. We show here the reality behind some of the 
'perceptions' put forward in Cllr John's claims:

## North of £100m profit overage
>"I believe the Council will receive north of £100m profit from the deal"

__Factcheck:__ Under the terms of the [regeneration agreement] that Cllr John 
signed with Lendlease, Lendlease is required to submit an 'annual business 
plan' to the Council on an annual basis, which outlines the current cashflow 
position of the development as well as any profit overage estimated to be due.  
The most recent annual statement shows clearly that no overage is due to the 
Council:

>"20-25% is a normal profit margin for developments in London"

This is not true. The district valuer who reviewed Lendlease's viability assessment, said that 15% was the normal profit margin assumed by developers. The Council is currently negotiating a development agreement 
with British land for the redevelopment of Canada Water, in which 15% is the agreed profit level. Why did Cllr John allow Lendlease to assume a much higher profit level.

If he really does subscribe to openness and accountability in his dealings with 
developers, we ask Cllr John to publish the following:

1. The advice he received from external consultants on signing the regeneration 
   agreement.

2. The appendices of the regeneration agreement itself.

3. The regeneration agreement for the Aylesbury estate, which the Council is 
   continuing to withhold.

4. Undisclosed DVS report

5. Annual Business Plan/Audit report

6. Viability Assessment for One the Elephant

The following annual report shows Lendlease reported a profit from Trafalgar Place in 2016:

## 11000 new council homes
Cllr John brushes off criticism with his usual spiel about how Southwark has 
got the country's largest council house building programme, with a target of 
building 11,000 new council homes over the next 30 years (366 per year).  
However, [data just published by the 
government](https://medium.com/@lukewbarratt/fact-checking-hackney-mayor-philip-glanville-on-social-housing-b3ceeeaf53e3#.149mqus0q) 
shows that during the last 12 months Southwark built just 74 new council homes.  
[Government 
data](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/568423/LiveTable_123.xls) 
shows that in the same year it demolished 410 homes.
