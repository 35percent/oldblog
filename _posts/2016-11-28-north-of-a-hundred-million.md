Council leader Peter John has been grilled by Australian national broadcaster 
ABC, in an interview about the Heygate redevelopment.

The interview was part of [this report by 
ABC](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-11-11/homes-for-profit-not-people./8019560), 
which was broadcast on australian television:

ABC reporter Steve Cannane has also published his full 20min interview with Cllr John, in which he defends the terms of the (shotgun) deal he [signed](http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/4712) with Australian developer Lendlease just weeks after taking up office in 2010:

To anyone who has been following the Heygate saga, several of the claims made by Cllr John during the interview are factually incorrect and misleading. It may be a while since Councillor John signed the regeneration agreement, but as a [barrister](http://fivepaper.com/profiles/peter-john/) in property law we would have expected him to have remembered a few of the details of the [contractual agreement](https://southwarknotes.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/ra.pdf) he signed, governing one of London's largest public/private partnership deals. To help jog his memory we have outlined some of the key details of the regeneration agreement.


## The profit share agreement
During the interview, Councillor John argues that the Council will receive a share of the 'overage' profits from Lendlease. But the regeneration agreement and [this Council briefing paper](/img/heygate_disposal_briefing.pdf) confirm that overage is only payable once the development is fully completed in 2025. Furthermore, the overage profit share arrangement only applies to profit surpluses over and above Lendlease's ringfenced 20% "Priority Return" plus a 2.6% "Management Fee"[^6], which was criticised by the [District Valuer's review](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/DVSreport_HeygateOutline.pdf) of the figures and described as 'additional profit'.

During the interview, Cllr John claims that _"20-25% is a normal profit margin for developments in London"_. However, the Council's own review of the scheme by the [District Valuer]() questioned this profit level and pointed out that most schemes average out below 15%:

* The amount of 'overage' payable (if any) is calculated by Lendlease, which has a track record for accounting disputes over such agreements; in April 2012 it was [fined](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/25/nyregion/lend-lease-expected-to-admit-to-fraud-scheme.html) $56m for overbilling authorities on a major public works contract in New York; in Dec 2012 it was [sued](http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/valuation-dispute-poses-threat-to-1b-return-from-barangaroo-20121206-2ay9e.html) by city authorities over its calculation of overage on a similar size regeneration scheme in Sydney (which the authorities [lost](http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/barangaroo-public-works-in-doubt-after-government-loses-court-battle-with-lend-lease-20140821-106lke.html)); and in 2014 it was embroiled in a [High Court battle](http://www.pitcher.com.au/news/lend-lease-decision-impact-property-development-arrangements) with authorities over the terms of a development contract in Northern Australia.

## Lendlease already drawing profit
The Council is yet to break even, having spent 51.4m on the cost of the scheme to date and having received just 18m of the 50m it will be receiving as a fixed payment from Lendlease. Meanwhile, in the six months up to February 2016, Lendlease [reported record profits](http://www.afr.com/real-estate/commercial/lendlease-firsthalf-net-profit-rises-121pc-to-354-million-20160216-gmvxux) of $354m(£192m), which it [claims](http://www.smh.com.au/business/property/lendlease-reports-a-3538-million-profit-20160216-gmvo2z.html) were partly down to _“strong sales momentum at residential projects at Victoria Harbour in Melbourne and Elephant & Castle in London”._

Its August 2016 financial report confirms that the completed phase 1 of the Heygate (Trafalgar Place) turned a profit in 2016 and that phases two and three (South Gardens and West Grove) are due to turn a profit in 2018/19.

*Extract from Lendlease's [financial report Aug 2016](/img/LLfinancialreport_aug2016.pdf)*

The above report also shows that Lendlease had presold 69% of its apartments in phase 3 (West Grove) off plan, netting it $435m (£260m) before construction had barely started.

During the interview Cllr John claimed that he believes the Council will eventually receive _"north of £100m"_ from its profit share deal with Lendlease and that he understood that profits would be shared in stages as the development proceeds.

We made an FOI request for the yearly audit report provided by Lendlease to the Council, which [showed](http://35percent.org/2016-05-11-no-profit-share-the-true-value-of-the-heygate-regeneration/) that _"no profit overage is currently forecast to be payable to Southwark Council"_.

## Key figures and documents still witheld
During the interview Cllr John claims that he has been open and transparent about his deal with Lendlease. However, the Council continues to withold key figures and documents relating to its deal with Lendlease. We call on the Council to stop hiding behind the mask of commercial confidentiality and publish the following documents without delay:

1. [The professional advice](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/financial_advice_on_signing_rege) that the Council leader received from external consultants on signing the regeneration agreement.

2. The missing appendices of the [regeneration agreement](https://southwarknotes.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/ra.pdf) between Southwark and Lendlease.

3. A full undredacted copy of the [District Valuer's report](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/DVSreport_HeygateOutline.pdf).

4. A full unredacted copy of the most recent [Annual Business Plan/Audit report](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/heygate_estate_regeneration_annu)

The last item on the list contains the following cash flow forecast, showing the key inflows and outflows to the development account which is key to understanding whether there will be any overage for the Council.

## Revolving doors
During the interview Cllr John was questioned on the integrity of accepting gifts and a trip to the South of France from Lendlease and whether it was right for senior Council officers to go on to work for Lendlease. Councillor John failed to give a direct response and instead muttered something about perception not always being reality. For the avoidance of any doubt we have published [here](http://35percent.org/revolving-doors/) the details of the senior officers who have gone on to work for Lendlease.

If Cllr John wants us to believe that he is being honest and open about the deal he signed with Lendlease then the figures must be published. If Cllr John believes that the profit share agreement will net the Council over 100m from Lendlease then he should show us that this forecast is based in fact and not just a figure plucked out of thin air. As we pointed out in a [previous blog post](http://35percent.org/2016-05-11-no-profit-share-the-true-value-of-the-heygate-regeneration/#advised-by-experts), that the Council was advised on signing the regeneration agreement by a consultant that also happens to be Lendlease's principal legal advisor. It's time for the Council to publish what advice it was given and come clean with all the other key figures it continues to withold.

## 11000 new council homes
Cllr John brushes off criticism with his usual spiel about how Southwark has 
got the country's largest council house building programme, with a target of 
building 11,000 new council homes over the next 30 years (366 per year).  
However, [data just published by the 
government](https://medium.com/@lukewbarratt/fact-checking-hackney-mayor-philip-glanville-on-social-housing-b3ceeeaf53e3#.149mqus0q) 
shows that during the last 12 months Southwark built just 74 new council homes.  
[Government 
data](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/568423/LiveTable_123.xls) 
shows that in the same year it demolished 410 homes.
