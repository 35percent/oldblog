A senior high court judge has blocked..


Confirms what we've been saying all along - Delancey can't be trusted with this regeneration... dodgy offshore company etc..

Southwark already has a CPO resolution in place (to oust traders) - this should be used instead to oust Delancey.

The money to buy out (at existing use value) can come from the _"upwards of Â£100m"_ that Southwark is supposedly to receive for the Heygate overage.

With the Tories in power for at least another 5 years it is time for our Labour council to show what innovative things it can do when it is in power instead of just rolling over to property developers.

Look at the innovative stuff that the Council has done in Peckham - Peckham levels etc.
