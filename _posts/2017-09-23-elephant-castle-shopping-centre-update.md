After a traders' deputation to Southwark Council and well over 200 objections to the planning application, developer Delancey has amended its plans for the demolition  and redevelopment of the shopping centre.  The original plans had [no provison for current traders, no affordable retail units and no social rented housing](http://35percent.org/2016-12-19-delancey-submits-shopping-centre-application/).  Delancey's amendments include a [draft local business support & relocation strategy](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s68297/Report%20Elephant%20and%20Castle%20Shopping%20Centre%20Equalities%20Analysis%20and%20Mitigation%20Projects.pdf), as well as more information about the [affordable housing](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!SeVE7nVBcuVxpQARghoUbA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) offer.

However, the application is not much better for any of these changes.  At local community meetings organised by the Walworth Society and Elephant Amenity Network, traders described the relocation strategy as 'vague'. There will be a relocation fund to assist traders, but Delancey will not say how large it will be, nor who exactly will qualify for payments.  Seven off-site units in the new Elephant Rd development are mentioned as alternative premises for traders, as well as unbuilt retail units at Lendlease's [Elephant Park](http://elephantpark.co.uk) and garage areas underneath nearby council block, Perronet House, but this is nowhere near enough - Southwark itself has identified [45 'local operators'](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s68297/Report%20Elephant%20and%20Castle%20Shopping%20Centre%20Equalities%20Analysis%20and%20Mitigation%20Projects.pdf), but there are many more, once kiosks, stalls and sub-leased shop units are taken into account.

Nor are there any proposals for either relocating the bingo hall and bowling alley or accommodating them in the new development.  This is a serious omission.  A new [equalities statement]( http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!jL6JkkYmmtpBMzdpRozUkA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) notes that both the elderly and people from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds form a large part of the bingo hall's clientele and would be adveresly affected should the application be approved. Southwark's failure to ensure that the Aylesbury estate's BAME leaseholders were fairly treated led to the [humiliating refusal](http://35percent.org/2016-09-18-aylesbury-compulsory-purchase-order-rejected/) of its compulsory purchase order application.

Delancey's [revised affordable retail offer](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!CgEoZ4vEh0beAm1jRSlUrA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) is craftily-worded (10% on the west site of the development, 5% on the east site), but because there is only a very small amount of retail proposed on the west site, the total amount across the whole site is only 5%; half of the 10% minimum policy requirement.  Delancey offers a cash payment in lieu, but doesn't say how much this is.

### 3% fake social rented housing   
Matte rs do not improve with the [affordable housing addendum](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!SeVE7nVBcuVxpQARghoUbA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d).  Delancey still refuses to include any proper social rented housing, but instead offers something it calls 'social rent equivalent', starting at £160pw, with a 3-year tenancy.  Rents will rise with inflat ion, but with the prospect of further rises, should your income rise.  It also looks as if 'social rent equivalent' will only be available to 'economically active' households; what these are is left undefined.  Delancey proposes 33 'social rent equivalent' units out of a total of 979 new homes - 3%. This falls well short of the current minimum [policy requirement at the Elephant & Castle](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/assets/attach/1817/1.0.5%20Elephant%20%26%20Castle%20SPD%20OAPF.pdf), which is 17.5% social rented housing. In December Delancey submitted a confidential viability assessment to the Council justifying why providing 17.5% social rented housing is not financially viable. Despite its new transparency policy and despite repeated calls, Southwark has still not made this viability assessment public.

The remainder of the 'affordable' rented housing we will be at 'London Living Rent equivalent', £205 - £308pw, and affordable rent at up to 80% market rent, depending on income.  60% of the overall affordable housing will be for households with incomes over £60,000 pa and up to £90,000pa.

None of this is in line with the [Elephant's current affordable housing policy](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/assets/attach/1817/1.0.5%20Elephant%20%26%20Castle%20SPD%20OAPF.pdf), which requires half of the minimum 35% affordable housing to be social rented.  Delancey should be providing 170 social rented units, instead of 33 fake social rent.    Nor does the affordable housing offer meet the required amounts in the [new, 'emerging' policy](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning-policy-and-transport-policy/development-plan/local-plan?chapter=4) Southwark is trying to sneak through the backdoor, to help the likes of Delancey reduce their affordable housing obligations.  Southwark has also vehemently [argued against including affordable rent in local housing policy](http://35percent.org/redefining-social-rent/).

Delancey's true intentions, if they were ever in any doubt, have been flushed out by these planning amendments - to do as little as possible for local traders and create a social housing-free zone at the Elephant and Castle.

Southwark Council has the power to stop them, by refusing not only to grant planning permission, but refusing to even consider the application in its current form.  Delancey needs to make provision for every trader to stay in the area and ensure that the bingo hall and bowling alley are integrated into their plans.  It also needs to provide proper affordable housing, including the full amount of social rented housing required by policy.

Southwark also has compulsory purchase order powers that Delancey is relying on, if it cannot come to an agreement with the longer term leaseholders, including the bingo hall.  Southwark must make it clear it won't do Delancey's dirty work and won't be seeking any compulsory purchase orders on its behalf while its plans don't comply with minimum policy requirements.

        <textarea name="message" id="message" cols="55" rows="10">Dear Southwark Planning,

I am writing to object to the revised planning application for the redevelopment of the shopping centre and LCC campus at the Elephant & Castle (ref:16/AP/4458).

Affordable Housing:
This application does not propose a policy compliant affordable housing mix. Southwark's policy for the Elephant & Castle requires a minimum of 35% affordable housing, of which 50% must be social rented. This should provide around 170 units but Delancey is proposing a different tenure and only 33 (0.3%) of the total units will be at social rent levels.

Affordable retail & existing traders:
The Council's strategic planning framework requires a minimum 10% affordable retail for new developments. Paragraph 5.1.7 of the Council's local planning policy (E&C SPD), further requires a number of "affordable retail units which are made available to existing occupiers displaced by development", in order to "ensure that development opportunities provide opportunities for existing and future SME businesses". The applicant's proposals fail to meet this and the Council's minimum 10% affordable retail requirement.

Bingo Hall:
Delancey is failing to make re-provision for the existing bingo hall. This is an importsnt social and community facility for 500 local pensioners every day. This important facility must be retained in any new development in order to ensure that community benefits are not lost without being replaced.

This application should not be considered by the Council until the above shortcomings have been addressed. 

Yours sincerely,
</textarea>
