## CPO archive
Compulsory Purchase Orders are a key part of any estate demolition and require the Council to put forward a _"compelling case in the public interest"_ for demolition. Below are links to archived CPO _Statements of Reasons_ for several estate regenerations to date. They provide an interesting record of the tenuous arguments used to justify demolition, for example: 

>"The scale and orthogonal formation of the blocks does not correspond to human scale, nor does it create opportunities for neighbourliness and local neighbourhood identity."[^6]

>"residents are deprived of a clear address, and identity."[^6]

>"High-level walkways .. contribute to crime and anti-social behaviour".[^6]

>"While the estate presents generous green space, the lack of designated use and the lack of ownership of these spaces mean that they are under used."[^6]

>"There is poor estate lighting, lack of ownership of open areas and lack of identity within the larger blocks".[^7]

>"an arrangement of monolithic land uses that is out of place in this city fringe location."[^8]
