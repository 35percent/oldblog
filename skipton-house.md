The latest large [planning application](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?casereference=15/AP/5125&system=DC) at the Elephant will provide zero affordable housing and zero social rented housing.  It is for Skipton House, behind the Bakerloo line tube entrance and it joins [Eileen House](/eileen-house), [Strata Tower](/strata-tower), [Tribeca Square](/tribeca-square), [360 Tower](/london-360-tower)  and [One the Elephant](/one-the-elephant) in the ongoing efforts to turn the Elephant into a [social housing free zone](http://35percent.org/2014-04-15-the-elephants-new-ivory-towers/).

The application is for 50,000 sq metres of offices, shops and 408 housing units.  An art house cinema is also proposed, as part of the ‘cultural offering’.   Developer London and Regional Properties (L&R) obviously believe this will compensate for not providing homes that anybody can actually afford to live in.  They say that  *‘The level of affordable housing that could be delivered in conjunction with the Development, and its cultural offer, will be determined through discussions with Southwark Council and the submission and appraisal of a Financial Viability Assessment’* [(Draft S106 Heads of Terms)]( http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7B%7B%7B!Q9j4UyN6s%2bjF93cJuCmxyg==!%7D%7D%7D%29) .
   
This is very gracious of L&R, but ignores the well-known requirement for 35% affordable housing, half of which should be social rented [(Core Strategy Policy 6)]( http://www.southwark.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/5823/adopted_core_strategy). This would give us about 143 affordable units, 70 of which would be social rented.

Instead, L&R propose to make a payment of £16.8m in lieu of providing any affordable housing, so that their site will be left unsullied by anyone who cannot afford what they estimate will be an average £820k price tag for a new home. This represents a pitiful 2% of the estimated total development value of the completed development (£747m). 

The [planning committee report](/img/OfficersReport.pdf) says that the Council's appraisal of the applicant's [viability assessment](/img/skiptonhouseFVA.pdf) disagrees with some of its assumptions. The Council's appraisal estimates that the developer has overstated build costs by £51m (14% - see para. 75). There is also a disagreement about the viability benchmark: the developer has estimated the Existing Use Value of the Skipton House office building at £120m, despite having paid just £53m for it. Neither is there any justification for L&R's stated requirement for a minimum 17.5% profit margin.

L&R support their argument by claiming that the development is one of *‘exceptional circumstances’*. L&R also trot out the well-worn argument that providing affordable housing means building a separate core (providing what's become known as 'poor doors') which in turn would  *'reduce the efficiency of the Development and ultimately the overall viability.'*  If this is not sufficient to convince Southwark to give up hope of any on-site affordable housing L&R adds another developer favourite, that *'the proposed strategy for the inclusion of the large communal residential terrace......would also need to be reflected in service charges for any affordable rented units'* (Quotes from [Planning Statement]( http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!rD%2bXXQJ%2bzV9QuBQgqt9pRw%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d)).

## Affordable housing: on-site comes first
When the Greater London Authority (GLA) was consulted on L&R's original application, it noted that there was no quantified affordable housing on offer and reminded both Southwark and L&R that *'the applicant is to prioritise on-site delivery as a first principle'* [(GLA Stage 1 referral 29)](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7B%7B%7B!kGxmoZgYgJk1gwYTnclyYQ==!%7D%7D%7D). L&R though, are not having this; they don't want their site blemished with affordable housing - it must be met by an in-lieu payment. 

## Financially challenged
Inevitably L&R have submitted a financial viability assessment (FVA) to substantiate their case. We [requested](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/skiptonhouse_objection.pdf) the assessment,  but the Council still hasn't provided either the FVA or its update, despite [trumpeting](http://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/closed-door-developer-deals-to-go-public/) the [adoption](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/info/200151/supplementary_planning_documents_and_guidance/3914/draft_development_viability_spd) of a new policy to make FVAs public.  We therefore don't know what the proposed scheme profits are or the critical benchmark value that determines viability. However, L&R emphasise in their application that the current  Skipton House is *'a profitable office asset'* with *'substantial existing use value'* [(Revised affordable housing statement 3.7)](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7B%7B%7B!WkLwEIO15MGZYh0JyBNStw==!%7D%7D%7D). So we can conclude that the viability benchmark will be high, making it that much easier to demonstrate an unviable scheme and thus dump affordable housing.

## Homeless - not wanted here
As well as depriving the Elephant of much needed affordable housing, L&R are intending to demolish a 35-bed homeless hostel on Keyworth St owned by Southwark Council. 
![](http://35percent.org/img/keyworthhostel.png)
*The (council-owned) Keyworth Homeless Hostel -  up for demolition*

L&R acknowledge that they risk a planning refusal should a homeless hostel be lost *'where it meets an identified local housing need'* but  Southwark comes to their rescue, with the council reportedly *'prepared in principle to relocate the Hostel elsewhere within the borough to continue to meet an identified local housing need'*  [(Planning Statement 8.10-8.12)](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7B%7B%7B!rD%2bXXQJ%2bzV9QuBQgqt9pRw==!%7D%7D%7D).
We can only conclude from this that Southwark believes that either we don't have a local homelessness problem at the Elephant, or that the need can be met by a hostel elsewhere in the borough.  Council  [housing data](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/13158/southwark_key_housing_data_october_2015) shows a staggering 92% increase in homelessness applications last year.

## Culture rules, housing suffers
There is no mention of any payments or compensation to Southwark for the loss of the hostel and the Council seems happy to help L&R factor out affordable housing from the scheme and demolish homeless hostels. Indeed, the stated priority of both parties is to establish the Elephant as part of a 'cultural triangle', along with the South Bank and Borough & Bankside ([Cultural Statement  5.10)](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7B%7B%7B!tlXP9gUbh1OWbngjrxPHzg==!%7D%7D%7D), rather than to build affordable housing. This trade-off between affordable housing and culture is made  clear in the [Planning Statement addendum 2.18](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7B%7B%7B!aD1mAdR0/EPvGtX4ZbkrRQ==!%7D%7D%7D) as is  Southwark's co-operation with L&R in shaping its proposal. ([Planning statement addendum 1.3](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7B%7B%7B!aD1mAdR0/EPvGtX4ZbkrRQ==!%7D%7D%7D)) 

Notwithstanding L&R's cultural ambitions, the 500 seat cinema has been replaced with a 350 seat performance venue in the revised application, with a wish list of uses [(Planning statement 4.12-4.15)](%28http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7B%7B%7B!aD1mAdR0/EPvGtX4ZbkrRQ==!%7D%7D%7D%29) - the consequent reduction in size is what allows the increase of affordable housing from 0% to 15%, according to L&R.

## Statutory objectors object
But L&R's cultural vision is not shared by several statutory consultees.  These bodies must be consulted about the application and are thought to be best qualified to judge its merits, including its cultural worth.

The [Twentieth Century Society](http://www.c20society.org.uk/) has [objected](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!esaPO98sP2f1NiF5lFzN5Q%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) to the development's over-sized massing and warns that it could _"cause harm to the architectural significance"_ of the neighbouring Goldfinger-designed Metro Central Heights.  

The [Theatres Trust](http://www.theatrestrust.org.uk/) makes various suggestions and ends its submission by [commenting](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!sFpO0ujuTlqkmzUkZsgKIA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) that it *"does not consider this venue to be an adequate replacement to the nearby Coronet Theatre'.*   The Trust adds *'Any advice issued for the Coronet site should ensure a retained or replacement c.2000 seat theatre and live music venue is provided within that redevelopment, to ensure there is not a reduction in the provision of local cultural offer.'*

Historic England have also [objected](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!D6dFghnKjdlivVL5TYwULQ%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) saying that _"the proposed tower will have a harmful impact upon the settings of conservation areas and listed buildings"_ in the local area and views from the Westminster World Heritage site.

## Who are L&R?
Our blog post  report would not be complete without some account of L&R.
In 2012 The Evening Standard [reported](http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/london-brothers-behind-a-4-billion-secret-empire-7600590.html)   that the company is owned by _"secretive"_ brothers, Ian and Richard Livingstone, who _"have built up a global empire with combined assets worth more than £4 billion"_.  They bought commercial properties in the early nineties and and made *'their first big fortune'* in 1993, when they sold their portfolio for £93m.  They  _"registered their master company, Strategic Properties Ltd, on the offshore tax haven of St Kitts and Nevis"_ (the Standard adds *'there is no suggestion that they tried to avoid paying British taxes'*).   

The Telegraph [reports](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/constructionandproperty/9644289/Ian-and-Richard-Livingstone-pay-themselves-124m-dividend.html) that the brothers like to pay themselves hundreds of millions in dividends each year;  [Companies House data](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/02909660/filing-history) shows that L&R hasn't paid any UK corporation tax since 2010 (when it paid just £1.9m); we note an  [office in Panama](http://lrp.co.uk/contact/).

L&R joins the [list](http://35percent.org/2014-05-05-manx-connections-the-off-shore-home-of-the-elephants-developers/) of other developers at the Elephant with offshore links and we note L&R is also one of the top 100 Tory party donors - as is [Delancey's Jamie Ritblat](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/PrivateEyeNo1311.pdf).

## In conclusion...
It seems incredible that Southwark are willing to entertain a planning  application from a rich off-shore connected developer, an application that at first didn't bother to say how much affordable housing it would build and is now using a criticised 'cultural offer' as an excuse to provide as little as possible. 

The Theatre's Trust comment shows the obvious way forward. Delancey, the owners and developers of the shopping centre, should be told that the Coronet must be retained and L&R told that they must provide 35% affordable housing on-site and that building a venue a fraction of the Coronet's size is not an acceptable excuse for not doing so. If this is done then the value of the Elephant as a cultural destination can  be maintained and a policy-compliant amount of affordable housing secured.
