![](http://35percent.org/img/phase1baerial.png)
*Aerial view of Phase 1b/1c Order land*

## Viability
Show how the figures were fiddled in the AAAP to make it look viable to get it through the examination in public.

![](http://35percent.org/img/Recommended_Changes.png)

Show how NHHT's credit rating has been downgraded by credit agencies since the last public inquiry.

Viability assessment for phase 1b/1c - find out when due and make an FOI request.

*Chase the ICO for our FOI for the full unredacted DPA.*

## DPA provisions breached
Show how NHHT has breached various provisions in the DPA including its obligation to purchase 5 street properties that it was to offer on shared equity terms to leaseholders in phase 1b/1c.

## Deliverability
Show how [Wood Dene estate](http://35percent.org/wood-dene-estate-regeneration/) was demolished in 2007 and how NHHT has [left the site empty](https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/notting-hill-admits-wood-dene-estate-peckham-wont-rebuilt-2019-thirteen-years-demolition/) for 10 years without building any new homes. This will be the future of phase 1b/1c. Manor Place depot was granted planning permission in 2015 but construction has still not started.

## Tenure switch
Submit copy of [Southwark's evidence](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/CPO_ExplanatoryNote12May2015.pdf) from previous Inquiry where they claim to have robust S106 monitoring procedures.

*Extract from Southwark's [evidence to first Inquiry](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/CPO_ExplanatoryNote12May2015.pdf)*

Submit copy of [Ombudsman decision](http://35percent.org/2016-12-12-ombudsman-slams-southwark-for-no-s106-monitoring/) and Sunday Times [article](http://35percent.org/img/ST23April2017.pdf) showing Southwark's failure to monitor S106 AH tenure delivery because it doesn't actually have any monitoring procedures and therefore misled the previous Inquiry.

Highlight NHHT's other developments where social rent intended but affordable rent delivered - i.e. the one in Lambeth delivered on the [Claremont East estate](http://35percent.org/2017-01-16-draft-more-on-notting-hill/#claremont-east-estate-lambeth).
Show how the breach at Bermondsey Spa hasn't been resolved, i.e. the Council hasn't taken effective action to recover the SR homes - i.e. there still remains a net loss across the Bermondsey Spa and Manor Place Depot sites.  

Re-run all of our previous criticisms of Kate Davies and her predeliction for affordable rent and privatisation. Include also Steve Hilditch's recent [article](https://redbrickblog.wordpress.com/2017/01/07/one-article-does-not-wipe-the-slate-clean/) criticising Davies and Notting Hill (Hilditch is a former board member).

## Bashing NHHT 
[Southwark News article](https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/housing-association-slammed-nightmare-scenario-eviction-threat-bermondseys-st-james-estate/) on rent hikes and evictions
MP Neil Coyle's criticisms and Cllr Pollak's quote saying NHHT is acting like a 'predatory landlord'. 

![](http://35percent.org/img/nhhtevictions.png)

Wood Dene estate and Decathlon sites appear to have stalled. Point out affordable scandal at the Decathlon site (blog post to be drafted still) and the low level of social rented housing at the Wood Dene site. Make the point that NHHT successfully argued (using viability assessments) that it wasn't viable to provide more than the pitiful 15% (avg) social rented housing across both sites. So how can it be possible that the FDS site can viably provide over 40% social rented?

Silwood estate - 3 missing social rented housing units.

Manor Place Depot?

Show HCA/GLA stats showing how many thousands of homes they have converted to affordable rent and how much more money this is making them. 

## Maydew House
Why can't same be done with Aylesbury?

[This report](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s56449/Report%20Major%20works%20status%20report%20incorporating%20Warm%20Dry%20and%20Safe.pdf) describes different funding for DHS works, including the 'GLA Backlog fund' and the [accompanying appendices](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s56450/Appendices%201%20-%204%20Major%20works%20status%20report%20incorporating%20Warm%20Dry%20and%20Safe.pdf) show that the Four Squares estate (a High Investment Needs estate) was brought up to DHS for just £12m. Work out how much this is per unit and also show similar comparables.

On the question of sources of funding, one could also include the Section 106 off-site pooled funding and that set aside for new Council homes.

This Cabinet item from 2011 gives details of 'High Investment Needs estates' and gives cost estimates of DHS works: http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieIssueDetails.aspx?IId=11030&Opt=3

Appendix 6 shows the Aylesbury as not being the most costly of the estates. We could find out the actual costs of other estates on the list and do a comparison. Link to appendix 6: http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s19628/Appendix%206%20List%20of%2015%20High%20Investment%20Needs%20Estates.pdf

Southwark has in any case already [committed £12.5m to Major Works](http://35percent.org/img/Aylesbury-Phase-2-newsletter-February-2017-JH.pdf) bringing homes on the estate up to Decent Homes Standard.

## PSED
The only Equalities Assessment conducted on the scheme to date (the [2009 EqIA which accommpanied the AAAP](http://35percent.org/img/EqualitiesImpactAssessment.pdf)), relied upon the mitigation measures in place at the time for leaseholders- i.e. the rehousing options enshrined in the Council's [2006 rehousing policy](https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0ahUKEwiK2rTIssTTAhULCcAKHZeFDgUQFggrMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.southwark.gov.uk%2Fdownload%2Fdownloads%2Fid%2F1850%2Fexecutive_report&usg=AFQjCNHDwIaNCnRYD2HSNaCATPoHFjbtbA) which included the like-for-like 'propery swap' for leaseholders. The 2006 policy and the Council's [Handbook for leaseholders](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/331856/response/818864/attach/3/64145%20RedR%20Homeowner.pdf) clearly state the 'property swap' as one of the available rehousing options:

*Extract from the [Leaseholders Handbook](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/331856/response/818864/attach/3/64145%20RedR%20Homeowner.pdf)*

The EqIA specifically references the 2006 rehousing policy for leaseholders which it says offers leaseholders the _'widest possible choice of rehousing opportunities'_:

![](http://35percent.org/img/widestpossiblechoice.png) 

Given that the 'property swap' option was subsequently withdrawn in 2010, it can be argued that the scheme doesn't comply with the PSED because one of the mitigation measures set out in the EqIA which underlies the AAAP have been withdrawn. Indeed it was the only mitigation measure that would have enabled leaseholders to remain homeowners in the borough. 

Inspector Coffey said that leaseholders are left with two bleak options: moving out of the area or remaining but being impoverished. Like-for-like swap was the only option that would have enabled leaseholders to remain in the area without being impoverished. *We will need to show that the shared equity deal impoverishes leaseholders despite change in the £16k policy*

## Non conformity with AAAP


### BRE Sunlight/Daylight
Show in detail how the private high-rise blocks on the park front will seriously affect daylight in the affordable units behind.

Policy A6.7.8 of the AAAP says _"At least 75% of apartments in each
development should have dual aspect."_
How many of the homes on the FDS are due to be dual aspect?

### Sustainable Energy
Show how the sustainable energy requirements of the AAAP are not being adhered to - ie. biomass (see draft blog on phase 1a missing biomass)

[This press release](http://www.24housing.co.uk/news/first-new-homes-completed-on-aylesbury-estate/) says that biomass was to be provided on phase 1a but we know from classeur blog post that biomass was never provided.


In its [Energy Strategy](/img/aylesburyenergystrategy2.pdf) submitted pursuant to conditions of the S106 agreement, NHHT says that the zero carbon homes requirement has been removed.


### Cycling Infrastructure
What does the AAAP say about cycling infrastructure and other transport infrastructure?

### Open Space
Net loss of 1.8 hectares of open space - is this in conformity with the AAAP?

### Density

![](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/aylesburygreenspace.png)

The AAAP says _"The HCA has also recently admitted Aylesbury phases 2 and 3 to round 6 of the government backed Private Finance Initiative (PFI). Under this programme it is proposed that the council will effectively deliver 1000 new homes of which around 400 will be affordable council owned new homes"_.

We know that the HCA PFI finance was scrapped shortly after the AAAP was adopted. 

The AAAP says that 1419 units are required in phase 1, but given that only 408 units have been delivered on the other phase 1 sites [1a (261 units) & site 7 (147 units)] and only 830 units are proposed in the FDS application then there is a shortfall of 181 between the number of units proposed on the Order Land and the number required by the AAAP.

![](http://35percent.org/img/aaapphasingdensity.png)

The AAAP says that the scheme will deliver 1,450 extra new homes to contribute to the London Plan requirement of 16,300 new homes by 2016/2017. We can show that the scheme is providing less than the 1,450 promised and that Southwark has failed miserably to come anywhere near the 16,300 target.

![](http://35percent.org/img/aaapnewhomesdensity.png)

Provide evidence showing the vast gap between the number of units required by more recent planning policy and the numbers being delivered. Show how this is the cause of the current housing crisis.

## Room Sizes
The AAAP says that:

![](http://35percent.org/img/aaapsizeofhomes.png)

Does the accommodation schedule in the planning application for the FDS conform with these requirements?
