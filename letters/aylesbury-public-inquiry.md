Viability assessment for phase 1b/1c - find out when due and make an FOI request.

Chase the ICO for the full unredacted DPA.

## Deliverability
Show how Wood Dene estate was demolished in 2007 and how NHHT has [left the site empty](https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/notting-hill-admits-wood-dene-estate-peckham-wont-rebuilt-2019-thirteen-years-demolition/) for 10 years without building any new homes. This will be the future of phase 1b/1c. Manor Place depot was granted planning permission in 2015 but construction has still not started.

## Tenure switch
Submit copy of Southwark's evidence from previous Inquiry where they claim to have robust S106 monitoring procedures.
Submit copy of Ombudsman decision and Sunday Times article showing Southwark's failure to monitor S106 AH tenure delivery because it doesn't have any monitoring procedures.
NHHT's other developments where social rent intended but affordable rent delivered - i.e. the one in Streatham delivered on an LB Lambeth estate.
Show how the breach at Bermondsey Spa hasn't been resolved, i.e. the Council hasn't taken effective action to recover the SR homes.  

Re-run all of our previous criticisms of Kate Davies and her predeliction for affordable rent and privatisation.

MP Neil Coyle's criticisms and Cllr Pollak's quote saying NHHT is acting like a 'predatory landlord'.

## Environmental disbenefits
Given Inspector Colley's comments on the environmental disbenefits and the fact that these were not explored in detail during the previous Inquiry, we should take the opportunity to explore them this time. We should cover a section on sunlight/daylight issues and also loss of public accessible open space.

## PSED
The only Equalities Assessment conducted on the scheme to date (the [2009 EqIA which accommpanied the AAAP](/img/EqualitiesImpactAssessment.pdf)), relied upon the mitigation measures in place at the time for leaseholders- i.e. the rehousing options enshrined in the Council's [2006 rehousing policy](https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0ahUKEwiK2rTIssTTAhULCcAKHZeFDgUQFggrMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.southwark.gov.uk%2Fdownload%2Fdownloads%2Fid%2F1850%2Fexecutive_report&usg=AFQjCNHDwIaNCnRYD2HSNaCATPoHFjbtbA) which included the like-for-like 'propery swap' for leaseholders. The 2006 policy and the Council's [Handbook for leaseholders](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/331856/response/818864/attach/3/64145%20RedR%20Homeowner.pdf) clearly state the 'property swap' as one of the available rehousing options:

*Extract from the [Leaseholders Handbook](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/331856/response/818864/attach/3/64145%20RedR%20Homeowner.pdf)*

The EqIA specifically references the 2006 rehousing policy for leaseholders which it says offers leaseholders the _'widest possible choice of rehousing opportunities'_:

Given that the 'property swap' option was subsequently withdrawn in 2010, it can be argued that the scheme doesn't comply with the PSED because one of the mitigation measures set out in the EqIA which underlies the AAAP have been withdrawn. Indeed it was the only mitigation measure that would have enabled leaseholders to remain homeowners in the borough.
