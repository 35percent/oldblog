## Scheme no longer in accordance with the development plan
@. A key requirement of the compulsory purchase code is that the Scheme underlying the Order must conform with the requirements of the statutory development plan. Paragraph 76 of the [06/04 ODPM Circular](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/compulsory-purchase-and-the-crichel-down-rules-circular-06-2004) lists a key consideration as _"whether the purpose for which the land is being acquired fits in with the adopted Local Plan for the area"_ and specifies that _"any programme of land assembly needs to be set within a clear strategic framework, and this will be particularly important when demonstrating the justification for acquiring land compulsorily under section 226(1)(a) powers as a means of furthering the well-being of the wider area."_.

@. The adopted Local Plan for the Scheme underlying this Order (“the Scheme”) is the [Aylesbury Area Action Plan 2010](http://www.2.southwark.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/13132/aylesbury_area_action_plan_2010_inc_appendices) (“AAAP”) [CD2], which was adopted in January 2010 as part of the Acquiring Authority's local development framework.

@. As a result of the [withdrawal of £180m government funding](http://www.2.southwark.gov.uk/news/article/159/government_to_withdraw_pfi_funding_for_aylesbury) envisaged by the AAAP and subsequent changes in housing policy affecting the viability of the Scheme, it now fails to comply with the following requirements of the development plan:

 * Minimum number of new homes requirements
 * Net loss of affordable housing requirements
 * Dwelling size requirements
 * Minimum space standards
 * Wheelchair accessible requirements
 * Tenure requirements
 * Renewable Energy requirements
 * Building Heights requirements
 * Sunlight/Daylight requirements
 * Open Space requirements
 * Transport/public realm requirements
 * Private Amenity Space requirements
 * Dual aspect design requirements
 * Privacy and overlooking requirements
 * Play Space requirements
 * Land use requirements
 * Density requirements
 * Monitoring and compliance 
 * Infrastructure/public sector funding requirements
 * Rehousing/PSED mitigation requirements
 
## Breach of housing uplift requirements
@. The AAAP said that  the scheme would deliver 4,200 new homes - a net uplift of 1,450 over the existing estate. The @AAAP said that this would help contribute to and conform with the London Plan requirement of 16,300 new homes by 2016/2017.

@. Paragraph 88 of the [planning committee report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!Vbu5QpckfYCnJrulzlWyuQ%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) for the outline application re-iterates that _"A key objective of the AAAP (Policy BH1 Number of homes) is to increase the number of homes on the estate"_. The Scheme underlying the order as it stands will fail to achieve this objective.

@. Appendix 5 of the AAAP specifies how many homes need to be delivered in each phase to achieve the 1,450 uplift in number of homes. It specifies a requirement for 425 new homes on (completed) phases 1a/site 7 but only 408 were provided. It also requires 880 new homes on the FDS, but the consented plans are to provide only 830 new homes.

![AAAP Appendix 5](http://35percent.org/img/aaapapp5.png)

@. The Acquiring Authority may argue that NHHT is submitting a revised planning application for the FDS (see paragraph 7.2 of its Statement of Case), but this will only increase the overall number of homes by 10 to 840. There still remains a significant shortfall.

@. The shortfall between the minimum number of homes guaranteed in the planning consent for remaining outline phases and the number required by the AAAP is much greater. Given that the FDS Scheme was approved in conjunction with the outline phases and shares the same section 106 agreement, the outline Scheme is inseperable from the FDS Scheme.

@. The Outline planning application sought consent to build a *minimum* of 1,700 new homes and *maximum* of 2,745 across the outline Scheme. It is understood that some flexibility may be required in an outline application, but there is no explanation as to why NHHT required such a significant amount of flexibility (1000 homes). The Outline application for the neighbouring Heygate estate regeneration (2,700 new homes) gave a flexibility between min and max provision of just 200 homes. 

@. The minimum specification of 1,700 homes is well below the AAAP requirement of 2,898 homes across the Outline phases and would result in the provision of just 2,948 new homes across all phases (1,700 plus 408 on completed phases plus 840 on FDS) - well short of the 4,200 required and an uplift of just 200 homes on the estate baseline[^2]. 

@. If the order is confirmed then there is nothing preventing NHHT delivering the Scheme according to the minimum specification, thereby failing to comply with key objective AAAP (Policy BH1 Increasing the Number of Homes). 

## Net loss of affordable housing requirements
@. The [planning committee report](http://pl anbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!Vbu5QpckfYCnJrulzlWyuQ%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) for the Outline Scheme acknowledges that if NHHT builds to the *minimum* specification, then _"the outline minimum scenario would result in a net loss of -559 affordable dwellings or -1542 affordable habitable rooms"_ (para. 98). It acknowledges that this would fail to comply with the London Plan requirements on net loss of affordable housing and the AAAP's requirement that there would only be a small net loss of affordable housing (150 dwellings). It will also result in the provision of just 1,634 affordable dwellings (210 in the completed phases, plus 560 in the revised FDS application, plus 864 affordable units in the consented Outline minimum specification). This falls well short of the 2,100 affordable housing dwellings required by the AAAP: 

![Extract from the AAAP](http://35percent.org/img/aaapnetloss.png)

@. In response to the shortcomings in NHHT's minimum proposed specification, the planning committee report goes on to explain (emphasis added):

>"with Phase 1A and Site 7 in place, and assuming that the FDS scheme is delivered in line with the current application, then an additional 4790 habitable rooms of affordable housing **in phases 2, 3 and 4** would be required to deliver full replacement of the baseline." (para. 101)

>"The applicant has therefore confirmed that they will commit to provide 50% of all habitable rooms as affordable housing, in line with AAAP policy BH3, or a minimum of 4790 habitable rooms of affordable housing **under the outline application**, whichever is the greater. This would ensure future phases will secure full replacement affordable housing, when measured by habitable rooms. This will be secured by a legal agreement along with a site wide affordable housing delivery strategy that will **set milestones for the required number of affordable habitable rooms on a phase by phase basis.**" (paras 102/103)

@. However, the section 106 legal agreement failed to secure these minimum requirements. It failed to set any _"milestones for the required number of affordable habitable rooms on a phase by phase basis"_ and failed to require _"a minimum of 4790 habitable rooms of affordable housing **under the outline application**"_. The provisions of the section 106 agreement instead required a minimum of 4790 affordable habitable rooms on the Outline Development **OR** 50% of all habitable rooms as affordable housing **accross the FDS and the Outline applications combined - whichever is the greater**.

![Extract from S106 agreement](http://35percent.org/img/minimumhr.png)

![Extract from S106 agreement](http://35percent.org/img/dpadevelopmentdefinition.png)

@. This subtle but significant change of wording enables NHHT to build a minimum of 4791 affordable habitable rooms across the FDS and Outline Schemes combined, as long as this represents 50% of the total housing across the sites.

@. As a result of the Acquiring Authority's failure to properly negotiate the minimum affordable housing requirement, and its failure to secure any minimum affordable housing requirement in its DPA with NHHT, if the order is confirmed it or (any other developer it may choose to assign the planning consent to (check this?)), will be able to build the Scheme out to the minimum specification and there will be nothing the Acquiring Authority can do to stop it. Note also the Acquiring Authority's failure to action against NHHT when it breached the terms of the section 106 agreement for the Bermondsey Spa regeneration.

@. The Acquiring Authority may argue that the section 106 provision governing the minimum affordable housing requirement should be interpreted according to its intention. 

@. However, NHHT's intention and interpretation of the provision is clear; its [June 2016 Housing Delivery Strategy](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!GB0ybg40uhtGW5vcbWkuZA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) submitted pursuant to the requirements of the s106 agreement, clearly show how it has combined both the FDS and the outline Schemes within the minimum 4790 affordable habitable rooms requirement:

![](http://35percent.org/img/housingdeliverystrategy.png)

@. A further loophole in the section 106 agreement's affordable housing provisions, can be found in the definition of habitable room for the purposes of calculation the minimum affordable housing provison. This allows any room larger than 27.5m2 to be counted as two habitable rooms for affordable housing provision. 

![Extract from S106 agreement](http://35percent.org/img/aylesburyoutlinehr.png)

@. Given that xx number of affordable homes proposed on the FDS and Outline scheme contain xx number of habitable rooms larger than 27.5sqm, this clause enables the double counting of xx affordable habitable rooms and will result in a tenure mix of xx% affordable/xx% private in terms of overall units. 

@. The Acquiring Authority may argue that the FDS Scheme should be regarded in isolation from the Outline Scheme (and the above loophole around habitable room calculation) because the section 106 agreement provides a schedule (Schedule 4) setting out the minimum number of affordable housing units to be provided on the FDS.

@. The Objectors submit that the Outline Scheme should not be seen in isolation because ...  and that in any event there will still be a significant net loss of affordable housing **floorspace** on the FDS if the schedule 4 of the section 106 agreement is complied with. 

@. Policy 3.14 of the London Plan resists the loss of affordable housing, without equivalent replacement (emphasis added): 

>"3.14B: Loss of housing, including affordable housing, should be resisted unless the housing is replaced at existing or higher densities with **at least equivalent floorspace**. 

>"3.82 ESTATE RENEWAL:  Where redevelopment of affordable housing is proposed, it should not be permitted unless it is replaced by better quality accommodation, providing **at least an equivalent floorspace** of affordable housing."

@. The London Plan is very clear that net loss of affordable housing is resisted and should be calculated in terms of **floorspace**.

@. The GLA stage 1 report for the outline site says that comprehensive floorspace figures for the Aylesbury estate are not available. However, paragraph 353 of the FDS planning committee report confirms that _"The total existing floorspace on the FDS equates to approximately 54,747sqm"_. 

![Extract from the [planning committee report for the FDS](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!JwAZWYwclvfEhXaN8JmiPA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d)](http://35percent.org/img/fdsbaseline.png)

@. Using the schedule of accommodation in paragraph 94 of the planning committee report combined with the table of room sizes in paragraph 5.2 of the revised affordable housing statement, the total proposed affordable housing floorspace is 28,293sqm. This shows a net reduction of affordable housing floorspace of 24,707 - more than half of the existing affordable floorspace.   

| Unit type | tenure | Quantity | Sqm | Total sqm |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 Bed | Social rent | 135 | 52.3 sqm | 7,060 sqm |
| 2 Bed | Social rent | 68 | 66 sqm | 4,488 sqm |
| 3 Bed | Social rent | 63 | 96 sqm | 6,048 sqm |
| 4 Bed | Social rent | 20 | 99 sqm | 1,980 sqm |
| 5 Bed | Social rent | 18 | 128 sqm | 2,304 sqm |
| 1 Bed | Intermediate | 37 | 50 sqm | 1,850 sqm |
| 2 Bed | Intermediate | 48 | 63 sqm | 3,024 sqm |
| 3 Bed | Intermediate | 15 | 89 sqm | 1,335 sqm |
| 4 Bed | Intermediate | 20 | 99 sqm | 2,204 sqm |
|  | |  |  | 30,293 sqm |

@. The Acquiring Authority is claiming that the Mayor’s Housing SPG says that the re-provision of housing may be considered in terms of units numbers and/or habitable rooms. However the SPG only says that this is permissible in relation to family homes (emphasis added):

>"5.1.14 Calculations of whether there is a loss of affordable or overall housing provision can be made on the basis of habitable rooms rather than dwellings, where the redevelopment of an estate is providing a housing mix more appropriate to the needs of both existing and prospective future residents – for example where there is increased provision of dwellings for larger households."

@. Given the proposed Scheme's shortcomings in relation to the objectives and requirements of the AAAP, the Objectors submit that the Scheme is not _"providing a housing mix more appropriate to the needs of both existing and prospective future residents"_ - for example, the Scheme fails to provide _"increased provision of dwellings for larger households"_. This is addressed in the following section explaining the Scheme's failure to comply with the minimum dwelling size requirements and minimum space standards.

@. The Objectors also note that NHHT's failure to ensure that there is no net loss of affordable housing may present a barrier to it receiving funding for the redevelopment. The Mayor's [funding agreement](http://35percent.org/img/standardformagreement2017.pdf) requires all estate regeneration schemes funded by his programme to comply with his [Good Practice Guide to Estate Regeneration](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/draftgoodpracticeestateregenerationguidedec16v2.pdf):

![Extract from the Mayor's [funding agreement](http://35percent.org/img/standardformagreement2017.pdf)](http://35percent.org/img/standardformer.png)

@. The Mayor's [Good Practice Guide](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/draftgoodpracticeestateregenerationguidedec16v2.pdf) in turn, states that _"demolition should only be followed where it does not result in a loss of social housing"_.

@. The Objectors note that the loophole of allowing NHHT to 'double count' habitable rooms in the calculation of the minimum affordable housing requirement, is not just written in to the small print of the section 106 agreement - it is also contained in the provisions of the DPA:

![Extract from the DPA](/img/hrloopholedpa.png)

@. NB: the 27.5sqm 'double counting' loophole in the s106 specifies that it relates only to the calculation of affordable housing. The clause in the DPA relates to the calculation of all residential units. 

## Breach of dwelling size requirements
@. The AAAP says _"There will be a significant proportion of family homes with 23% houses, together with all the facilities needed by families, to make sure that the whole area is family-friendly."_

@. However, the approved FDS planning consent provides only 6% houses. Although it provides 10% maisonettes, these are classified as flats for planning purposes.

@. Appendix 5 of the AAAP sets out the required number of unit sizes per phase:

![](http://35percent.org/img/aaapapp5.png)

@. Of the 60 3-bed dwellings required by the AAAP on completed phases 1a/site 7 - only 30 were provided. The AAAP requires 149 3-bed dwellings on the FDS but only consented 108. The AAAP requires 38 4-bed dwellings but only 32 were in the planning consent.

@. The shortfalls in the family homes required by the AAAP are far more severe on the Outline scheme under the minimum specification.

@. Paragraph 93 of the planning committee report for the Outline Scheme shows that the minimum specification would result in the reprovision of just 263 'social rented' family homes (3-bed and above). This compares with 776 social rented family units on the existing Outline site right now (874 listed in the S106 Heads of Terms for Outline and FDS combined, minus 98 social rented family homes on FDS). 

@. This will prevent the requirements of paragraph 7.2.6 of the AAAP being satisfied: _“We will accommodate approximately 50% of existing tenants through the re-provision of homes on site”._

@. The AAAP says that:

![Extract from the AAAP](http://35percent.org/img/aaapsizeofhomes.png) 

@. The Sustainability Assessment for the AAAP says: 

>"A recent Housing Needs Survey (2003) for Southwark identified 35,851 households stating a need to move in the next 5 years. Of those households, 48% stated the main reason for needing to move was that their home was too small and 54.3% needed a home with 3 or more bedrooms.

>"The revised tenure mix new option was chosen as it minimises the loss of affordable housing and will help develop a mixed and sustainable community. It will also ensure that the rehousing needs of existing tenants are met."

## Breach of minimum space standards
@. Paragraph 124 of the planning committee report for the Outline Scheme acknowledges that _"Since the AAAP was adopted, space standards have increased with the introduction of minimum dwellings sizes in the  London Plan (2011) and the adoption of the Southwark Plan Residential Design SPD (2011). The result is that the minimum space standards in the AAAP have been superseded by larger space standards in these more recent documents."_

@. The London Plan's and the New Southwark Plan's minimum space requirements are identical and are as follows:

![](/img/londonplanminspace.png)

@. The Outline Scheme's Affordable Housing Statement provides a breakdown of the minimum sizes of the social rented and intermediate affordable housing units across the Outline and FDS scheme:

![](/img/outlineminsize.png)

@. Read in conjunction with the schedule of accommodation in NHHT's [Design & Access Statement](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!SP7j9NgvVQ81I%2fbtk2kPWQ%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d), we can see that not one of the proposed dwelling sizes for any of the **flats** on the FDS or Oultine Scheme complies with the London Plan's or the New Southwark Plan's minimum space requirements.

## Breach of wheelchair accessibility requirements
@. Paragraph 7.22 of the Acquiring Authority's updated Statement of Case claims that the planning consent for the FDS complies with the minimum policy requirement of 10% Wheelchair accessible housing. It claims that there are 40 wheelchair accessible dwellings in the FDS planning consent. It also says that in addition there will be 13 wheelchair accessible homes in the Extra Care Unit.

@ This claim is inaccurate and misleading; firstly 53 homes out of a total of the 830 consented represents just 6.3%; secondly, the accommodation schedule (Table 6.2.1) of [Chapter 6.2 of the Design and Access Statement](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!pnGrAnPLMbqJKtFYPDeAWw%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) for the FDS planning consent says that there will be only 21 wheelchair accessible units. It says that in addition to these there will be 19 dwellings which will be **adaptable**; i.e. capable of being converted to wheelchair accessible homes: _"Of the 40 standard homes designated as wheelchair units, half will be **adaptable.**"_ 

@. The Acquiring Authority's Southwark Plan Policy DM6 says nothing about enabling **wheelchair adaptable** units to be counted in calculating provison. As such the consented Scheme will provide only 21 **wheelchair accessible** dwellings in the mixed tenure block and 13 wheelchair accessible homes in the Extra Care Unit. 

@. Policy DM6(1.3) of the Southwark Plan further stipulates that all wheelchair accessible must _"meet the saved minimum space standards of the South East London Wheelchair Housing Design Guide"_ and designed to comply with Building Regulation M4(3). Section 6.3, paragraph 1 of the Design and Access statement confirms that just 9 of the dwellings in the Extra Care Units conform to these standards. There is no evidence that any of the 21 wheelchair accessible homes in the remainder of the development comply to these standards or Building Regulation M4(3).

@. The Table 6.2.1 referred to above also shows that just 11 of these 21 homes will be social rented homes. 

@. As a result, the Scheme fails to comply with a key policy objective of the AAAP, which is to provide _"high quality social rented and private homes that address a variety of local needs,
including those of the elderly and vulnerable."_ (Policy 1.6.2)

## Breach of tenure requirements
@. The AAAP requires 37. 5% of all new homes to be social rented tenure. The AAAP was adopted before the introduction of the incoming Tory government's new Affordable Rent tenure. 

@. It is understood that NHHT is funding the social rented homes on the FDS with a grant from the GLA's Affordable Housing Programme 2016-2021. The GLA's [funding agreement](http://35percent.org/img/standardformagreement2017.pdf) for this programme does not provide for social rent. Instead it offers funding for a tenure named 'London Affordable Rent' (LAR). The funding agreement makes it clear that this effectively the Affordable Rent tenure and subject to regulations and legislation governing Affordable Rent:

![Extract from the Mayor's [funding agreement](http://35percent.org/img/standardformagreement2017.pdf)](http://35percent.org/img/rentstandardpara.png)

@. Furthermore, the funding agreement prescribes a specific formula for how LAR rent levels are to be set:

![Extract from the Mayor's [funding agreement](http://35percent.org/img/standardformagreement2017.pdf)](http://35percent.org/img/larformula.png)

@. This formula conflicts with the formula for the setting of social rents prescribed in the Rent Standard Guidance and will result in LAR rents increasing proportionally by more than social rents year on year, as social rents are required to be reduced by 1% each year (see section 23 of the Welfare, Reform and Work Act 2016).

@. LAR tenure is not social rented tenure required by the AAAP, it is subject to different regulation and legislation (enabling fixed-term rather than secure tenancies, pay to stay, etc). 

@. It is also noted that NHHT's revised planning applications for the FDS now include the provision of 'market rent' rather than private for-sale housing. This is a breach of the AAAP's tenure requirements, which specifically state 'private homes'. Homes rented on short-term tenancies by a housing association at market rent are not interchangeable with private for-sale homes; they are two separate types of tenure for planning purposes (check this?).

## Breach of renewable energy requirements
 @ . Sustainable development was one of the core principles of the development plan. Policy BH6([I] - ENERGY SUPPLY) of the AAAP requires new developments in the core action area to be serviced by one centralised energy plant:

>"The energy supply for the action area core will be generated by combined heat and power (CHP). The CHP plant should be part of an energy centre located immediately south of the junction of Thurlow Street and Inville Road and appropriately sized to accommodate plant required to deliver services to the development. The redevelopment of the action area core will result in zero carbon growth. All developments within the action area core must connect to the CHP system. Developments completed prior to the implementation of CHP should be designed so that they can switch to the CHP once it is available." 

@. Policy BH6([II] - USE OF RENEWABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES) envisaged that the CHP plant would be fuelled by renewable energy (biomass) and required developments completed prior to be fuelled by a minimum 20% __on-site__ renewable energy:

>"Developments should meet the London Plan target of a 20% reduction in CO2 emissions through the use of renewable technologies. Until such time as the CHP is fuelled by renewable energy sources and is capable of meeting the London Plan target, we will require developments to use their own CHP compatible on-site renewable energy technologies.
 
@. Paragraph 6.3.3 of the the AAAP's Sustainability Assessment explains the vision futher:

>"New developments will also need to reduce carbon emissions by 20% using carbon renewable technologies. Currently, the most feasible way of doing this would appear to be by providing biomass CHP in the energy centre."

@. However, the Scheme falls short of these requirements in that the biomass plans have been dropped and the development on the FDS will be serviced by its own separate individual (non-renewable) gas-fired CHP plant, which will have the 'potential' to be connected to the proposed energy centre on Thurlow St, but won't be serviced by it. This is acknowledged in the planning committee report for the FDS application, which says:

>"Whilst the AAAP envisaged a single energy centre being provided, the proposal is for an Energy Centre within Block 5 of the FDS with another energy centre being located close to the Albany Road/Thurlow Street junction as part of the Outline Scheme."

@. Justification for shelving the biomass plans is given in the FDS planning application's Revised Energy Strategy which says:

>"Site specific analysis for Solar Thermal, Biomass Heating, Wind turbines and Heat Pumps are shown in Appendix A as they are not recommended for the site. This applies to both the Detailed and Outline application at this stage."

>Appendix A - "BIOMASS HEATING: This technology is not recommended due to additional air quality concerns involved when including this technology in an urban area. This fuel source is also not considered for CHP as a larger scale of plant is required before this is suitable. The additional burden of fuel storage and delivery would also hamper development."  

@. The planning committee report for the application acknowledges that the Scheme _"falls far short"_ of complying even with the 20% minimum on-site renewable energy requirement:

>"Photovoltaic panels are proposed for the areas of roof that will achieve enough sunshine tomake them viable. Currently this stands at 697sqm. It is acknowledged that this represents a small proportion of the available roof space across the FDS however, as a result of the townscape requirements that sought taller buildings on the park edge with heights reducing incrementally northwards, much of the remaining roof space is overshadowed by the taller elements to the south. The proposed photovoltaic panels will achieve a 3.72% carbon dioxide saving and whilst it is accepted that this falls far short of the 20% target it is accepted that this is an ambitious target to meet in a highly urbanised area." (Paragraph 365)

@. The 20% minimum on-site renewable energy requirement is not just a requirement of the AAAP, it is also a requirement of both the AA's strategic planning framework [(Core Strategy)](http://www.2.southwark.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/13131/core_strategy_2011) and the London Plan.

@. Policy 3.6.1 of the AAAP requires the Scheme to result in 'zero carbon growth':

>"The development will be designed to result in zero carbon growth, that is, no net growth in carbon dioxide emissions despite an increase in the number of dwellings. This will require buildings which are highly energy efficient."

@. The Acquiring Authority has produced no evidence that the Scheme complies with this requirement of the AAAP. Moreover, the section 106 agreement only requires a minimum 3% renewable energy across the FDS and outline scheme:

![](http://35percent.org/img/renewablesrequirement.png)

@. The planning consent for the order land fails to comply with any of these policies, which are a core objective of the development plan. The Objectors have submitted a [sample](http://35percent.org/img/aylesburynewvsoldepc.pdf) of Energy Performance Certificates (EPC) showing that, despite not having double glazing installed, the existing dwellings on the order land are more energy efficient than the Aylesbury new-build apartments on the neighbouring completed phase 1a of the Scheme (Roffo Court).

![New-build EPC (left) existing Aylesbury estate (right)](http://35percent.org/img/epcomparison.png)

@. The EPC certificates for completed phase 1a of the Scheme confirm that it did not provide any renewable energy either. Futher [documentation](http://35percent.org/img/Totters_Court.pdf) shows that the development is fuelled by a central gas boiler. 

@. This is a breach of the planning consent for phase 1a; the [planning committee report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!EBAeY2lWKnBCMyOrbAnyPA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) for the development said that it would be fuelled by a central biomass CHP:

![Extract from the phase 1a planning committee report](http://35percent.org/img/biomassboilerproposed.png)

@. Here is an extract from the [planning officer report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!ZjnzKbe5kK9g1qbkCkoQdQ%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) for a subsequent application to install the biomass boiler and thereby discharge the requirement.

![Extract from officer report re- application to discharge biomass requirement](http://35percent.org/img/phase1abiomass.png)

@. The Acquiring Authority may attempt to argue that a revised planning application is currently being prepared, but the Objectors point out that it is very unlikely that this will meet the more stringent zero carbon policies introduced since the original 2014 planning consent was granted. 

@. In March 2016, The Mayor of London set out the approach to achieving the London Plan policy aim of 'zero carbon homes' for major developments in the Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (SPG), published in March 2016.

![Policy 5.2b of the London Plan](http://35percent.org/img/lpextractzerocarbon.png)

@. Policy 3.6.7 of the AAAP envisaged this requirement for zero carbon homes: _"The government has announced the intention of ensuring that all homes are CfSH Level 6 by 2016. Proposals will need to comply with these regulations where these are more stringent than CfSH Level 4."_ 

@. Southwark’s SPD on Sustainable Design and Construction says that 95% of all demolition waste must be either re-used or recycled, in line with the London Plan requirement. No evidence has been provided to show that the Scheme is compliant with this policy. 
 
## Breach of public realm and sunlight/daylight requirements
 @. It was pointed out during the previous inquiry that the tall buildings (all private units) running east to west along the frontage to Burgess Park, will result in a significant number of homes in the affordable blocks behind them failing to meet BRE minimum daylight requirements.

@. This was taken up by the inspector at the previous inquiry and the criticisms outlined in detail in paragraphs 368-370 of her report do not need repeating. The planning committee report also openly acknowledges the Scheme's shortcomings in relation to daylight requirements:

>"It is acknowledged that failure to achieve full compliance with BRE guidance for minimum ADF levels is a less positive aspect of the proposal" (paragraph 139)   

@. Paragraph A6.6.3.7 says that _"Tall buildings should achieve some visual separation from adjacent developments."_

@. Policy PL4 says that there should be two tall buildings on the order land ranging from 10-15 storeys, but the consented plans show three tall buildings along the Albany Road frontage, ranging from 14 to 20 storeys.

@. Policy PL4 also says: "The design of these taller buildings needs careful consideration. They should be elegant and slender. Proposals should demonstrate that harmful effects on residents, pedestrians and cyclists, such as overshadowing and wind funnelling, will be minimised.

@. Paragraph 5.223 of NHHT's planning statement explains that one of the reasons for the sunlight/daylight failure is because _"the development proposes the tall buildings along the park boundary to maximise the number of apartments with a view of the park"._

@. Policy A6.5.5 of the AAAP provides some mitigation for the impact of the tall blocks:

>"The frontage along Burgess Park must include a strong building line, allow for a range of heights and massing and include excellent architectural design. The park front should be designed to allow for light into rear courtyards and allow for views and glimpses from the park into the areas beyond the immediate front."

@. Policy A6.5.7 envisages that this will be achieved using a series of 'green fingers' - _"a series of multi-functional spaces that link with Burgess Park"_ : 

>"A series of ‘green fingers’ will be created, extending from Burgess Park into the action area core interlinking the park with the development. Their predominant function is that of a public space with social interaction, pedestrian and cycle movement dominating."

![Extract from the AAAP's Visual Impact Assessment](http://35percent.org/img/visualimpactassessment.png)

@. Besides enabling daylight, the AAAP envisages that the green fingers will _"provide an important part of the overall public open space in the AAP area. They will extend Burgess Park into the residential development, allowing people to move easily from their homes to the park. They will also enable many more homes to have a frontage along pleasant green spaces. The green fingers will provide a range of functions including children’s play areas, water management and pedestrian and cycle movement."_ (policy 4.2.6)

![Extract from the AAAP](http://35percent.org/img/greenfingerintersections.png)

@. The green fingers also enable several key 'green links' envisaged by the AAAP, which link neighbouring local parks to Burgess Park.

![Extract from AAAP](http://35percent.org/img/networkofgreenspaces.png)
@. The AAAP diagram for the order land shows one of the green fingers dissecting the FDS (10) and a second open space, Westmoreland Plaza (9) on the north-west corner of the order land.

![Extract from AAAP](http://35percent.org/img/fdsgreenfingers.png)

@. However, the planning application for the FDS Scheme and masterplan failed to include the green finger (labelled in the AAAP as 'King William IV Green Finger'[0.24ha]) and Westmoreland Plaza is now shown as being provided on the existing open space situated on the adjacent completed phase 1a site. 

![Extract from Design & Access Statement [CD43]](http://35percent.org/img/fdsmodel.jpg)

@. The removal of the green fingers from the Scheme, means that the propsals for the order land will now suffer from the very problems that the AA has attributed to the estate in its grounds for redevelopment - lack of permeability, dark alleyways etc and will not enable the AAAP's objective of creating better quality open space/public realm. Moreover, the consented scheme will result in a significant net loss of open space.
 
@. Paragraphs 154 to 162 of The planning committee report for the FDS say:

>"BRE guidance recommends that for outdoor amenity areas to be adequately sunlit throughout the year at least half of a garden or amenity area should receive at least 2 hours of sunlight on 21 March. In terms of the communal courtyards within Blocks 1, 4, 5 and 6 only the courtyards within Blocks 4 and 5 achieve the minimum requirement of at least 50% of the space receiving at least 2 hours sunlight on the 21 March."

>"The courtyards of Block 1 and 6 will achieve 2 hours of sunlight on the 21 March across 39.6% and 26.7% of their respective areas and as such fall below the 50% target. Whilst this does not mean the amenity space is of poor value it does mean that the greater proportion of the courtyards will be in the shade and as such careful consideration will need to be given to the type and form of landscaping that will be provided within these communal areas to allow them to be used effectively throughout the year. 160. Blocks 2 and 3 both contain a significant amount of terraced housing with private rear gardens. These gardens are located between the rear facades of the blocks of terraced dwellings which face north and south away from each other. Of these 49 private amenity spaces only three meet the March target with the rest of the gardens in the shade as a result of shadows cast by the taller elements of Blocks 4 and 5. During the summertime, when amenity spaces will be more intensively used, all but two will be well lit in terms of having in excess of 50% of the area receiving at least two hours of sunlight."

>"Of the amenity spaces that fail to meet the March target, there are 26 spaces that do not receive any sunlight on the 21 March and will be completely in the shade. As is the case with the courtyards of Block 1 and 6, this does not mean that the amenity space is unusable for this part of the year subject to careful landscaping considerations. Achieving compliant sunlight levels within the private and communal amenity spaces on the FDS has been a challenge largely due to the need to provide a significant uplift in housing units and density whilst meeting the townscape objectives of the AAAP which sought taller development along the park edge, perimeter blocks and then lower density housing towards the north of the site to manage the transition between high and low density areas. Having the taller buildings to the south of the site results in long shadows being cast which has resulted in many amenity spaces being in the shade."

@. Inspector Coffey's report summarises the sunlight/daylight issues well:

>"given that it is intended that these dwellings will replace existing housing which benefits from good standards of daylight internally and well lit sunny amenity areas, the scheme for the FDS would not improve the environmental well-being of the Order Land." (paragraph 370)

Note to Chris: obviously we are going to have to revise this section once the revised planning application is submitted and we have been able to review how the sunlight/daylight issues have been address, or not as the case may be.

## Breach of open space requirements
@. Policy PL5 (Open Space) of the AAAP says:

>"New development must provide a high quality network of public open spaces of different sizes and functions which link well together and contain good pedestrian and cycling routes."

@. Policy 4.5.1 of the AAAP requires no net loss of open space through the Scheme. There is no information provided on the net loss of open space on the FDS site alone, but the planning committee report for the Outline Scheme does provide an analysis which aggregates net loss including the FDS site and it acknowledges that there will be a net loss of 1.8 hectares of open space:

![Extract from the planning committee report for the masterplan application.](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/aylesburygreenspace.png)

@. Furthermore, the majority of the replacement open space will be privately managed by a subsidiary company set up by NHHT. Only the smallest of the three new open spaces on the FDS (Albany Rd Frontage[400sqm]) will be public open space adopted by the Council. 

![Extract from FDS planning application docs 15/AP/4584](http://35percent.org/img/aylesburyopenspaces.png)


@. Paragraph 261 of the planning committee report for the FDS confirms that the planning consent will include 157 on-street parking spaces. 

@. There has been double counting in the calculations for the provision of open space on the FDS. The planning application has sought to include 'Westmoreland Square' - an existing amenity space on the neighbouring phase 1a site, measuring 1,350sqm. Paragraph 207 of the FDS planning committee report acknowledges that the application merely _"expands and completes Westmoreland Square Plaza, the first part of which was laid out within Phase 1a"_.

@. The other public open spaces proposed on the order land comprise:
 * 'Westmoreland Park': 1,130sqm
 * 'Portland Park': 880sqm
 *  Albany Road frontage: 400sqm

@. The combined floorspace of these represents approximately 10% of the existing open amenity space on the order land.

@. As mentioned in the previous section, the AAAP said required a 'Green Finger' open space to be provided on the FDS named "King William IV green finger", which was supposed to provide 0.24ha of new public open space (2,400sqm).

@. The current FDS planning consent clearly falls well short of the open space requirements proposed in the AAAP.

## Breach of transport/public realm requirements
@. The AAAP says that the Scheme should provide an improved and modern cycle enviroment (quotes).

@. As a statutory consultee, TFL objected to NHHT's planning application, in its [formal response to the application](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!4pokZj%2fGk2vz59bcWED5rw%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) it said that _"The Masterplan is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to provide an exemplar walking and cycling environment .. However, TfL is concerned that the application material fails to demonstrate this."_

>"The proposals for Thurlow Street and Albany Street in particular, key streets in the Masterplan, are considered poor. These two roads are also earmarked in the TA for freight, servicing and construction traffic, which underlines the need for better provision for cyclists. East-west links, and permeability to the surrounding areas, particularly beyond Old Kent Road and Walworth Road, are not adequately considered, nor are the linkages to the Council’s proposed ‘Southwark Spine’ cycle route along Portland Street."

>"The Masterplan should encourage active travel, prioritising walking and cycling over motorised modes. This can only be achieved through the creation of safe and appealing streets, easy access to public transport, a coherent cycle network, and attractive cycling facilities. TfL is not currently satisfied that this approach is being taken."

>"The application material fails to propose a coherent network of safe, accessible and welcoming cycle routes. All of the pedestrian routes should be accessible to cycling unless there is a clear and justified reason they should not be. The total lack of segregation proposed in the Masterplan does not reflect current policy and guidance."

>"The TA predicts a significant uplift in bus passenger demand (over 280 additional trips in the AM peak). Buses passing the site are already crowded, and TfL is seeking an extension of a route from Elephant and Castle to support the FDS, funded through the s106 agreement for that site. The additional demand from the Masterplan will require further capacity enhancements. Therefore £3.75m (indexed) is sought, to be secured in the s106 agreement for the Masterplan, to fund for these enhancements for the first five years of operation, for example increasing the frequency of operation on route 42."

@. It is unerstood that NHHT only agreed to pay £1.5??m... check s106 agreement

>"TfL recommends that across the Masterplan area, at least two medium sized (30) point docking stations should be provided, one of which should be located in the FDS. At an absolute minimum 60 docking points are required across the Masterplan area. This will reduce stress arising from the development on the already heavily used nearby existing Cycle Hire docking stations. Space should be reserved in the masterplan for a Cycle Hire docking station together with one in the FDS, and should be secured in any subsequent planning permission. Further details of the location and space requirements for this can be provided by TfL. £200,000 (index linked) should be secured in the Masterplan s106 agreement, to cover the cost of delivery and maintenance of this docking station."

@. It is understood that NHHT resisted TFL's requirement for a cycle docking station on the FDS. (obviously need to check whether revised application incorporates it)

@. This is a breach of the Acquiring Authority's Cycle Strategy, Sustainable Transport SPD and Policy DM46(5) of the New Southwark Plan which makes requirements for cycling including: _"providing space within the development, where required for the expansion of the cycle hire scheme;"_

@. The Objectors note that this of particular relevance given that the order land adjoins the Acquiring Authority's proposed 'Quietway 7' cycle route from Crystal Palace to Elephant & Castle (along Portland Street on the west border of the order land) and the site was recommended for a docking station by the Acquiring Authority's own 'Cycle Survey' commissioned by LB Southwark road safety team in 2015 (Site UniqueID:132). 
 
## Breach of private amenity space requirements
@. Policy PL7 of the AAAP says:

>"All development must contain high quality private open space in the form of communal gardens, private gardens and useable balconies. The design of communal gardens should comply with the guidance in Appendix 6."

@. The appendix 6 refererred to in appendix 6 says:

>"All dwellings must have direct access to private open spaces, whether in the form of a garden, roof garden, courtyard or balcony. 1/2 bedroom dwellings must have a minimum of 6 sqm of private amenity space. Larger dwellings should aim to meet the minimum standards set out in the Residential Design Standards SPD."

@. The Residential Design Standards SPD requires 3 bed flats to have a minimum of 10sqm and _"For new housing, a minimum of 50sqm of private garden spaces is required and this should be at least 10m in length. The private gardens should extend across the entire width of the dwellings."_

@. Paragraphs 143 and 144 of the planning committee report re-affirm these requirements:

>"The AAAP Appendix 6 requires at least 6sqm private amenity space for one and two bedroom flats with the remaining units being required to meet the minimum private amenity space standards set out in the SPD Residential Design Standards. The SPD requires flats with three or more bedrooms have a minimum requirement of 10sqm. With regards to houses, the SPD seeks private gardens that are at least the width of the house, extend at least 10 metres in depth and provide 50sqm of garden space. This requirement also applies to ground floor maisonettes."

@. Paragraph 147 of the planning committee report for the FDS, confirms that only one terraced dwelling in block 2 meets with the minimum 10 metre depth requirement and eight further dwellings fail to meet the 50sqm minimum garden space requirement. Paragraph 148 confirms that none of the dwellings in block 3 meet with the 10 metre depth and only five meet with the 50sqm garden space requirement.

@. The Objectors note that the planning committee report has incorrectly sought to offset the above shortfalls against the communal amenity space provided. The Residential Design SPD says that this is permissible, but only in relation to new flat developments (policy 3.2) not new detached, semi-detached or terraced houses (policy 3.1). 

## Breach of dual aspect design requirements
@. Policy A6.7.8 of the AAAP says _"At least 75% of apartments in each development should have dual aspect."_

@. Paragraph 128 of the planning committee report confirms that only _"70% of apartments and maisonettes/duplex units"_ on the FDS site will be dual aspect
 
## Breach of privacy and overlooking requirements
@. Appendix 6 of the AAAP expects proposals to ensure that the privacy of occupants is protected without compromising the ability to create a compact urban neighbourhood. It does not set out specific requirements for separation distances, but instead references the Residential Design Standards SPD. 

@. The Residential Design Standards SPD, specifies a minimum rear-rear separation distance of 21m but paragraph 140 of the planning committee report acknowledges that _"there is one point at which the distance between habitable windows for the general needs flats reduces to 14 metres, but generally the distance is between 17m and 20m."_

## Breach of play space requirements
@. Policy 3.6.2 of the AAAP says: _"We will require children’s play areas to be integrated into the residential areas. About 3 hectares of children’s play space and youth space will be provided"_.

@. Policy PL6 of the AAAP says _"All development proposals must provide 10sqm of children’s play space / youth space per child bed space. Doorstep playable space should be provided within each of the housing blocks, whilst larger local playable spaces should be provided within selected housing blocks and within the green fingers and existing local parks, in accordance with Figure 12. New youth space should be provided within the larger areas of public open space."_

@. The New Southwark Plan provides further detail on how the 10sqm of play space per bed space requirement should be calculated:

![](/img/NSPchieldyield.png)

Both the consented FDS and Outline plans fall well short of this requirement - (exact figures to be inserted here). 

![Play space on the FDS that is not being replaced](/img/aylesburyfdsbasketballcourt.jpg)

## Breach of Layout/land use requirements
@. The AAAP laid out the parameters for the layout of the development on the FDS as six blocks. The layout for the consented plans proposes just four blocks.

@.AAAP policy __'COM6'__ requires the Scheme to _"Provide 1,750 square metres of new local retail facilities (convenience retail, cafes and restaurants) within the action area core"_, in order to create a mix of uses.

@. Appendix 5 of the AAAP specifies that the FDS should provide a minimum of 250sqm retail space, but the consented plans do not propose any retail floorspace whatsoever. Paragraph 80 of the FDS planning committee report justifies the compliance failure by arguing that NHHT is providing 250sqm of D1 or D2 use class, permitting it _"to be used as an Early years facility or a gym subject to need and demand"_.

@. The shortfalls on the Outline Scheme against the AAAP's land use requirements are greater: there is a shortfall of 546sqm of retail; 1900sqm of offices and employment use; and 487sqm of community use.

@. The AAAP requires 263sqm of community use facilities on the FDS, but the consented plans only make provision for 250sqm. for the outline application shows how both the FDS and Outline Schemes fall short of the AAAP mixed use requirements:

![[Planning committee report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!Vbu5QpckfYCnJrulzlWyuQ%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) for the outline application](http://35percent.org/img/outlinecommunityspace.png)

## Breach of infrastructure funding requirements
@. Page 75 of the AAAP describes infrastructure funding. It says the developer will pay a tariff which will fund community facilities like the health centre and other community facilities. However, we now know that the Council is paying for the £35m cost of them mainly from its own funds.

@. [This press release](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/news/2017/feb/a-35m-investment-into-new-community-facilities-at-heart-of-one-of-london-s-biggest-regeneration-projects-has-been-approved) confirms that the Acquiring Authority is footing £23m of the £35m required from its capital budget. The DPA confirms that the remainder is being sourced from s106 contributions from other developments in the borough plus a £9m contribution from NHHT.

@. Paragraphs 7.8 and 7.9 of the Acquiring Authority's updated Statement of Case acknowledges that NHHT taking role of delivery partner is a change to Policy D2 of the AAAP. Are NHHT meeting full financial obligations under Policy D2?  A table of expected payments, totalling c £50m, is given at A7.1.40 AAP pg 174; it includes £1.47m for green fingers and £12m for improvements to Burgess Park. There is nothing in the DPA obliging NHHT to make a contribution towards improving Burgess Park. (xx - more research required)

## Breach of Public Sector Equalities Duty (PSED) 
@. The AAAP said there will be a 'range of options to enable leaseholders to stay in area, buy into new scheme etc..'

@. This was discussed in more detail in the Equalities Assessment conducted in conjunction with the AAAP.
(the [2009 EqIA which accommpanied the AAAP](http://35percent.org/img/EqualitiesImpactAssessment.pdf)), relied upon the mitigation measures in place at the time for leaseholders- i.e. the rehousing options enshrined in the Council's [2006 rehousing policy](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/1850/executive_report) which included the like-for-like 'propery swap' for leaseholders. The 2006 policy and the Council's [Handbook for leaseholders](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/331856/response/818864/attach/3/64145%20RedR%20Homeowner.pdf) clearly state the 'property swap' as one of the available rehousing options:

![Extract from the [Leaseholders Handbook](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/331856/response/818864/attach/3/64145%20RedR%20Homeowner.pdf)](http://35percent.org/img/aylesburyleaseholdershandbookoptions.png)

@. The handbook gives a detailed description of the property swap policy available to leaseholders:

![Extract from the [Leaseholders Handbook](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/331856/response/818864/attach/3/64145%20RedR%20Homeowner.pdf)](http://35percent.org/img/aylesburyhandbookswap.png)

@. The EqIA specifically references the 2006 rehousing policy for leaseholders which it says offers leaseholders the _'widest possible choice of rehousing opportunities'_:

![Extract from the AAAP's EqIA](http://35percent.org/img/spiritofcooperation.png)  

![Exract from the AAAP's EqIA](http://35percent.org/img/widestpossiblechoice.png)  

@. Given that the 'property swap' option was subsequently withdrawn in 2010, it can be argued that the scheme doesn't comply with the PSED because one of the mitigation measures set out in the EqIA which underlies the AAAP has been withdrawn. Indeed it was the only mitigation measure that would have enabled leaseholders to remain 100% homeowners in the borough - i.e. not impoverished by the shared ownership options. 

@. Inspector Coffey said that leaseholders are left with two bleak options: moving out of the area or remaining but being impoverished. Like-for-like swap was the only option that would have enabled leaseholders to remain in the area without being impoverished. *We will need to show that the shared equity deal impoverishes leaseholders despite change in the £16k policy. (Investigate service charges etc)*

## Scheme is not viable and therefore not deliverable.
@. There are three main factors which demonstrate that the Scheme is not viable:

 1. The Scheme was not viable in the first place
 2. £180m of allocated government funding has been withdrawn since the AAAP was adopted
 3. The government has cut the amount housing associations can charge for (social) rents and introduced a cap in Local Housing Allowance
https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2012/aug/09/housing-benefit-caps-end-tenancies-in-london

### The scheme was not viable in the first place
@. The AAAP's Sustainability Assessment said:

>"Early financial modelling indicated that about 5000 homes would need to be provided on the footprint of the estate to make any redevelopment financially viable. All the options therefore were predicated around this figure."

>"Following consultation on these options, the council decided to revise options relating to housing, in order to meet concerns that the scheme needed to be more family friendly. These revisions related to housing tenure, density, type of homes, bedroom split, tall buildings and provision of private amenity space. The overall numbers of units to be provided were reduced from 5,000 new dwellings to 4,200 new dwellings."

@. Documents submitted prior to the examination in public of the AAAP in 2009, show that the Aylesbury scheme as envisaged is was not viable and that the viability gap is being bridged by shortchanging leaseholders. In Jan 2009, the [draft Aylesbury Area Action Plan](http://35percent.org/img/DraftAAAP.pdf) showed that there was a funding shortfall of £299m. 

![Page 92 of the [appendices](http://35percent.org/img/DraftAAAP_appendices.pdf) to the [draft AAAP](http://35percent.org/img/DraftAAAP.pdf)](http://35percent.org/img/DraftAAAP_appendices.png)

@. The ability to be able to deliver an Area Action Plan is one of the government’s key tests on the “soundness” of the plan and a requirement that a plan meets these tests of soundness.

@. The inspector at the examination in public of Southwark's AAAP, [flagged up](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/352116/response/873296/attach/3/160926%20EIR%20FOI%20685920.pdf) the significant funding gap to the Council and her [final report](http://35percent.org/img/AAAP_inspectors_report.pdf) on the AAAP shows that the Council's solution was to arbitrarily slash the cost estimates, without providing any evidence base or justification for doing so. The £130m originally estimated for leasehold acquisitions of the circa 500 leasehold properties on the estate was slashed by half. There is no explanation as to why the Council slashed its estimate of the market value of leaseholders' homes by 50% overnight. 

![[Table of Recommended Changes to AAAP (2009)](http://35percent.org/img/Table_of_Recommended_Changes.pdf) showing cost estimates slashed](http://35percent.org/img/Recommended_Changes.png)

@. Altogether, the cost estimates were reduced by around a half, reducing the funding gap from £299m down to £169m and this is the figure given in the [final adopted version of the AAAP](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/downloads/download/4444/area_action_plans). 

![Extract from final adopted version of [Aylesbury Area Action Plan 2010](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/downloads/download/4444/area_action_plans) showing the funding gap](http://35percent.org/img/aaapfundinggap.png)

### £180m of central government funding was withdrawn from the Scheme post adoption of the AAAP
@. The Acquiring Authority was expecting to cover the funding shortfall with government PFI funding and this is how the Area Action Plan was deemed sound at its Examination in Public. However, just under a year after the Area Action Plan was adopted, the government [withdrew](http://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/dec/26/cut-regeneration-tony-blair-housing) all PFI funding for the scheme. 

@. The September 2011 board meeting minutes of the Aylesbury New Deal for Communities (by now renamed Creation Trust), confirmed that _“at the time of writing the AAAP each [affordable housing] unit was supported with £125k of funding, this has now been reduced to £25,000”_ [OCD24, para 2.4]

@. At the previously inquiry NHHT claimed that it had 'applied' for central government funding from the Estate Regeneration Fund. Given that there is no mention of this in the Acquiring Authority's updated Statement of Case (check this?), the Objectors seek clarification as to whether NHHT's application was accepted and if so details of the funding awarded.

@. It is understood that the only funding allocated to the scheme is that secured by NHHT for the FDS from the Mayor's current AHP funding programme for his new 'London Affordable Rent' tenure. This amounts to £60,000 funding per affordable dwelling and is still not even half of the original funding envisaged by the AAAP.

### The government has reduced the social rent levels that housing associations can charge.
@. In 2015, the government introduced reforms to the amount of rent housing associations can charge under social rented tenancies in its Housing & Planning Act, forcing them to reduce social rents by 1% per year.

@. NHHT's 2016 financial statement confirmed that _"Following changes announced by the Government in July 2015, we paused our start on sites to reassess scheme viability and to review our blend of tenures to reflect Government priorities .. Starts on site slowed down as we paused to reappraise the tenure split of schemes following the social rent cuts announced in the Government’s summer budget."_

@. In September the Acquiring Authority announced at a [Cabinet meeting](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s63817/Report.Aylesbury%20Regeneration%20Delivery.pdf) that _"the impact of measures in the Housing and Planning Act have reduced the ability of NHHT’s Board to progress Phase 2 and Plot 18 at this stage"_. 

![Sep 2016 Cabinet report](/img/sep2016cabinet.png)

@. The Cabinet report went on to say that NHHT was no longer willing to continue underwriting the ongoing costs of the scheme and that the Acquiring Authority has decided to step in and provide funding instead. (para. 12)

@. NHHT's board's refusal to continue funding the Scheme as a result of viability concerns, provides evidence that just because NHHT is running a bumper surplus and has liquidity, it's board will not proceed with schemes that are not financially viable, regardless of any contractual obligations to do so. 

@. The Objectors note the evidence provided to the previous inquiry, with which the Acquiring Authority successfully argued that there was both board-level approval and contractual requirements in the DPA obliging NHHT to proceed with the FDS Scheme regardless of whether it is viable or not. (see paras 92 and 388 of the inspector's report) 

@. The Acquiring Authority's updated Statement of Case claims similarly: "this phase of the development is not subject to viability testing"_. NHHT's board decision not to continue funding the Scheme provides clear evidence to the contrary.

@. In June 2016 NHHT was [downgraded](http://35percent.org/img/nhhtmoodys.pdf) by Moodys. Moodys' downgrade notice mentioned NHHT's significant development pipeline and its three major schemes; the Aylesbury estate, Canada Water and a scheme in Hounslow. 

@. The Moodys report states that just 7% of the homes in NHHT's pipeline are social rent. So the replacement 'social' homes on the FDS must have been included in these figures as affordable rent. To conclude: Moody's capex to revenue ratio must have been based on the provision of affordable rent not social rent. Had it been based on social rent then the capex to revenue ratio would have been much higher. So either Moodys have been given incorrect info on the tenure mix of NHHT's pipeline or the replacement 'social rent' homes on the Aylesbury will be affordable rent..

![Extract from Moodys downgrading [announcement](http://35percent.org/img/nhhtmoodys.pdf)](http://35percent.org/img/nhhtmoodys.png)  

@. NHHT's recently announced a 'mega' merger with Genesis housing association will exert additional pressure on NHHT as well as raise concerns that the differences in style and approach may affect board level decisions and commitment to the Scheme, especially in light of the viability issues.

## Failure to demonstrate Scheme is viable and therefore deliverable 
@. Paragraph 16 (iii) of Appendix A of the 06/2004 Circular says(emphasis added):

>"Any decision about whether to confirm an order made under section 226(1)(a) of the 1990 Act will be made on its own merits, but the factors which the Secretary of State can be expected to consider include .. (iii) the potential financial viability of the scheme for which the land is being acquired. A general indication of funding intentions, and of any commitments from third parties, will usually suffice to reassure the Secretary of State that there is a reasonable prospect that the scheme will proceed. __The greater the uncertainty about the financial viability of the scheme, however, the more compelling the other grounds for undertaking the compulsory purchase will need to be__. The timing of any available funding may also be important. For example, a strict time-limit on the availability of the necessary funding may be an argument put forward by the acquiring authority to justify proceeding with the order before finalising the details of the replacement scheme and/or the statutory planning position."

@. The Objectors submit that there is indeed _"great uncertainty about the financial viability of the scheme"_ and that therefore the Acquiring Authority is required to make a _"more compelling"_ case for _"the other grounds for undertaking the compulsory purchase"_. 

@. Paragraph 19 of the ODPM 06/04 Circular states that “If an Acquiring Authority cannot show that all the necessary resources are likely to be available to achieve that end within a reasonable time-scale, it will be difficult to show conclusively that the compulsory acquisition of the land included in the order is justified in the public interest.”

@. Paragraph 20 of the ODPM 06/04 Circular says:

>"In preparing its justification, __the acquiring authority should provide as much information as possible__ about the resource implications of both acquiring the land and implementing the scheme for which the land is required. It may be that the scheme is not intended to be independently financially viable, or that the details cannot be finalised until there is certainty about the assembly of the necessary land. In such instances, __the acquiring authority should provide an indication of how any potential shortfalls are intended to be met. This should include the degree to which other bodies (including the private sector) have agreed to make financial contributions or to underwrite the scheme, and on what basis such contributions or underwriting is to be made.__"

@. Contrary to the requirements of paragraphs 20 of ODPM Circular 06/2004, insufficient information is given in the Acquiring Authority's Statement of Case, detailing the cost of the scheme or how it will be funded. 

@. The October 2015 review of the ODPM 06/04 Circular went to further to say the **substantive** information must be provided: _"the acquiring authority should provide **substantive** information as to the sources of funding available for both acquiring the land and implementing the scheme for which the land is required."_

@. In March 2016, the Acquiring Authority introduced a new policy ([Development Viability SPD 2016](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning-policy-and-transport-policy/supplementary-planning-documents-spd/spd-by-planning-topic?chapter=3)), requiring viability assessments to be submitted in conjunction will all planning applications involving the provision of affordable housing and requiring them to be publicly available.

@. The Objectors note NHHT's intention to submit a revised planning application for the FDS and therefore request that the viability assessment is made available for scrutiny **well before** commencement the inquiry.

@. Given the concerns about the wording of the existing section 106 agreement, the Objectors also request that a copy of the revised (signed) section 106 agreement is made available for scrutiny **well before** commencement of the inquiry. 

@. The Objectors also request that a copy of any funding agreements and full details of any other further funding commitments are supplied to **well before** commencement of the inquiry.

@. The Objectors note the DCLG's 10 May letter to the Acquiring Authority, containing a warning that any delay in providing information may result in a request for adjournment: _"It is important that those whose interest or rights are included in the order should be in a position to put their case at the inquiry without having to probe for further details. If they have to do this during the inquiry, they may not be in a position to deal with the additional information and this could lead to a request for an adjournment."_
 
## Impacts of viability on deliverability and well-being
@. The Objectors submit that the non-viability of the Scheme may result in it not be delivered in a reasonable time period. 

@. The [Wood Dene estate](http://35percent.org/wood-dene-estate-regeneration/), an estate owned by the Acquiring Authority in Peckham, was demolished in 2007 and is due to be redeveloped by NHHT. However, it has [left the site empty](https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/notting-hill-admits-wood-dene-estate-peckham-wont-rebuilt-2019-thirteen-years-demolition/) for 10 years without building any new homes. This Objectors submit that this will be likely future of the FDS if the order is confirmed.  

![](http://35percent.org/img/nhhtwooddeneadmission.png)  

@. The AAAP said that the FDS development would be completed by 2016. The DPA says that the FDS will be completed by 2021, but NHHT have now put this back to 2024. See [here](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s68300/Appendix%202%20Draft%20development%20agreement.pdf).

@. This is further evidence of the Scheme's failure to comply with the development plan and contractual requirements. It is also a breach of the compulsory purchase code (ODPM 06/04), which says that the Acquiring Authority must show that there is a _"realistic prospect of the land being brought into beneficial use within a reasonable timeframe"_. The Objectors submit that seven years is not a reasonable timeframe.

@. The Objectors note that there is nothing in the DPA compelling NHHT to complete any of the development phases should they be declared unviable.

@. The Objectors submit that the non-viability of the Scheme is likely to result in a failure to conform with the affordable housing requirements of the development plan

@. The Acquiring Authority has argued that social rented tenure is guaranteed by provisions of the DPA, but DPA refers only to 'target rent', which is not a recognised affordable housing tenure. There is no mention in the entire DPA of the term 'social rent'.

![Extract from the DPA](/img/Aylesbury_targetrent.png)

@. Para 4.8.4 on page 136 of the DPA says that if (confidential) viability assessments show that the scheme has become unviable then changes to the businees plan and DPA will be sought.

@. Para 4.8.6 says that both parties will be free to terminate the DPA if phases are deemed unviable.

@. The Moodys downgrade report confirmed that on average NHHT is delivering 7% social rented housing across schemes in its current pipeline and this is despite NHHT having received record levels of funding. 

@. The Objectors submit that in the absence of dedicated government funding to replace the PFI funding anticipated at the time the AAAP was drafted, the minimum 37.5% social rented housing across the Aylesbury scheme us undeliverable.

@. The Objectors submit that if the Order as it stands is confirmed, then the shortfall will be made up both by continuing to shortchange leaseholders and passing off affordable rented tenure as social rent.

@. This has indeed been the fate of several other schemes completed by NHHT. It was shown at the previous inquiry how NHHT had delivered affordable rented homes at up to 62% market rent at its Bermondsey Spa regeneration, when social rent was agreed in the DPA, planning committee report and section 106 agreement.

@. The same is true of NHHT's regeneration of the Claremont East estate in neighbouring Lambeth. This was sold by Lambeth Council to NHHT on the basis that it would provide "100% social rented housing". 

@. However, NHHT later submitted a viability assessment claiming that it was no longer possible to provide this and Lambeth agreed to lower the quota. In March 2011, Lambeth granted planning permission for just 40% affordable housing, of which 70% social rented. 

![Extract prom planning committee report for NHHT's Claremont East estate application](http://35percent.org/img/claremontplanningcommittee.png)

@. An investigation by the 35% Campaign researching GLA data, showed that the social rented units had been provided instead as affordable rent of up to 68% market rent - the very same tenure switch that NHHT pulled at the Bermondsey Spa regeneration.  

@. Affordable rent was introduced in 2011 to allow housing associations to charge higher rents (up to 80% market rent) to its tenants. The mayor has recently introduced several other social housing tenures, including 'London Living Rent' and 'London Affordable Rent'.  

@. The AAAP specifically requires that a minimum 37.5% of the new homes must be social rent. At the time the AAAP was drafted social rent was the only rented social housing tenure. The AAAP predates affordable rent and the other new tenures that have been created. The AAAP specifically states its aim as to help 'most vulnerable' to remain in area - to rehouse tenants on the estate footprint etc. and this is why it specified such a high proportion of social rented homes that would guarantee remained affordable for existing tenants.

@. Given the deregulation of the housing association sector which has ensued after the AAAP was adopted, it is no surprise that existing Aylesbury tenants are not taking up the replacement 'social housing' on the completed phases. With a clear lack of any political will to halt the transition from social rent to affordable rent, is is no surprise that of the xxx tenants decanted from the FDS, only xx have been rehoused on the footprint and of the xxx decanted from the next phase  (phase 2) only 34 have been rehoused on the footprint. 

@. The fear over rising housing association rents is exacerbated not just by the sudden deregulation of the sector but also fierce lobbying by housing association to be able to increase rents as they see fit. 

@. NHHT is one of the most active lobbyists among housing associations. In 2007, its CEO Kate Davies - then a member of the thinktank CSJ along with Iain Duncan Smith, co-authored a paper in which she claimed that _‘social housing is not a desirable destination’_, that _‘private ownership is preferable to state provided solutions’_ and that social housing providers should be able to sent rent levels without restrictions:

![Extract from Kate Davies' CSJ report](http://35percent.org/img/csjquoterents.png)

@. In 2011, when the government introduced its controversial affordable rent tenure, allowing social rents to be converted and increased to up to 80% market rent, NHHT was one of just two housing associations that wrote in supporting the proposed reforms.

@. Indeed, Kate Davies was a key advisor to the extremely influential [Localis review](http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/5568/1/Ends_and_Means_The_future_roles_of_social_housing_in_England_1.pdf) (Principles for Social Housing Reform by John Hills), which had proposed the reforms.

@. [This Guardian article](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/mar/29/tenants-face-70m-rent-rise-as-social-housing-converted-to-affordable-homes) shows that NHHT has switched 853 social rented homes to affordable rent over just the first 3 years of its introduction, earning it an extra £3.3m in annual rental income.

@. The Objectors submit that the non-viability of the scheme will result in NHHT delivering affordable instead of social rent. At the previous inquiry, the Acquiring Authority argued that this would be prevented by the terms of the section 106 agreement requiring social rent rather than affordable rent. The Objectors responded that this was also the case at with the Bermondsey Spa regeneration where the Acquiring Authority had failed to monitor delivery and subsequently failed to enforce the terms of its section 106 agreement once the breach had been pointed out by the 35% Campaign. 

@. At the previous inquiru the Acquiring Authority submitted [evidence](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/CPO_ExplanatoryNote12May2015.pdf) claiming to have robust S106 monitoring procedures to ensure that providers deliver according to section 106 requirements.

![Extract from Southwark's [evidence to first Inquiry](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/CPO_ExplanatoryNote12May2015.pdf)](http://35percent.org/img/CPO_ExplanatoryNote.png)

@. Following the close of the previous inquiry, the 35% Campaign submitted a detailed complaint to the Local Government Ombudsman, listing ca. 40 futher suspected breaches in affordable housing tenure delivery. Following an investigation, the Ombudsman issued a [decision](http://35percent.org/2016-12-12-ombudsman-slams-southwark-for-no-s106-monitoring/) in which it was found that the Acquiring Authority had no monitoring procedures and did no checks whatsoever to ensure that providers delivered affordable housing in accordance with s106 tenure requirements. The findings were summarised in [thi Sunday Times article](http://35percent.org/img/ST23April2017.pdf).

@. The Ombudsman directed the Acquiring Authority to conduct a borough-wide audit of compliance and introduce s106 monitoring procedures going forward. The AA has sinced allocated just £60,000 to this audit which will pay for software and staffing. The Objectors submit that this is insufficient means to ensure compliance over the 20-year build programme and beyond.

@. The section 106 agreement for the FDS negotiated a sum of just £1,567 for the ongoing monitoring of compliance with planning obligations. This is clearly insufficient.

![](http://35percent.org/img/monitoringcontribution.png)

@. The Objectors submit that the previous inquiry was misled and request full evidence to be provided to the inquiry that it has conducted the audit as directed by the Ombudsman and is taking enforcement action on any breaches discovered.

## NHHT refusal to underwrite costs & adhere to DPA obliations as result of viability
 @. NHHT has breached various provisions in the DPA including its obligation to purchase 5 P&R (Purchase & Repair) street properties on the open market, that it was repair and subsequently offer on shared equity terms to leaseholders on the FDS, in order to provide a wider rehousing choice (see para 4.2.2.13 of the DPA Business Plan Section 4). The Council claimed in its response to a Cabinet question from leaseholders, that NHHT has indeed provided 2 such properties to leaseholders on the FDS, but the Objectors were not aware of such offers. The Objectors request that the Acquiring Authority provide details of these two properties and explain why only 2 of the 5 street properties have been purchased by NHHT under its obligations to the DPA and why none of the Objectors have not been offered a P&R street property. 

@. This is of particular importance given that in November 2015, one of the Objectors (whose mother is wheelchair bound) [wrote](/img/AgnesKabutoNHHTemails.pdf) to NHHT asking why it was unable to offer any properties with wheelchair access. NHHT responding by claiming that it didn't have any wheelchair-accessible properties available via the shared equity scheme and advised her to apply to the Council for rehousing assistance instead. (correspondence is [here](/img/AgnesKabutoNHHTemails.pdf).

@. The DPA also requires NHHT to provide 142 'target rent' homes from its own existing stock (outside the development area) to rehouse existing Aylesbury tenants, 35 of which to be provided by 2017 - (paras 4.2.2.2 and 4.2.3.4 of the DPA Business Plan section 4).

![Extract from DPA](http://35percent.org/img/schedulenhhtoffsiteprovision.png)

@. The Objectors request that the inquiry is provided with details of how many of these 35 have actually been provided and used to house existing Aylesbury secure tenants? The DPA also says that NHHT will purchase a number of street properties and offer them to Aylesbury tenants at 'target rent'. According to the DPA 3 of these should have been provided by 2017. The Acquiring Authority is requested to provide details confirming that this provision has also been fulfilled.

@. NHHT's commitment to the Scheme is further brought into question when the Acquiring Authority declared at a [Cabinet meeting](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s63817/Report.Aylesbury%20Regeneration%20Delivery.pdf) in September 2016, that "_due to the costs"_ and _"CPO delay"_, NHHT was no longer willing to continue underwriting the ongoing costs of the scheme, i.e the demolition costs for the FDS and costs of design plus preparing the planning applications for the two subsequent phases of development - as per its obligations under the DPA: 

![Extract from Sep 2016 Cabinet report](/img/nhhtunderwrite.png)

@. The DPA stipulates that NHHT must pay the demoliton costs in respect of the FDS (para 4.1.4), the demolition cost was subsequently to be deducted from the £16.3m total (of 3 fixed land payments £1.2m; £2.4m; £12.7m) - (para 1.2.2) that NHHT was supposed to pay the Acquiring Authority upon transfer of the land.

@. NHHT's refusal to carry out its obligations under the terms of the DPA means that, not only is the Acquiring Authority now having to fund the £16.8m demolition costs itself plus a 2% management fee to NHHT, but it will only receive the third (and largest £12.7m) of the £16.3m fixed payments when the FDS development is completed in 2024. 

@. In summary, the Acquiring Authority is having to stump up £16.8m, of which it will receive just £16.3m in return in at least 7 years time - resulting in a net loss on the sale of 4.4 hectares of public-owned land.

@. The Acquiring Authority may argue that it has an 'overage agreement' in the DPA, meaning that it receives a percentage share of NHHT's 'overage' profit. However, such agreements bring notoriously uncertain results, as demonstrated by the Acquiring Authority's regeneration of the Silwood estate in Bermondsey that it redeveloped in partnership with NHHT. A similar agreement here resulted in an 'overage' payment of just £546,047 to the Acquiring Authority. An [FOI request](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/silwood_estate_regeneration_site/new) shows that there was disagreement between the parties about the amount of overage paid with the Acquiring Authority arguing that more overage was due.

@. In total, Southwark agreed to underwrite £26.5m of the ongoing costs of progressing the scheme (over the next 3 years alone) and that NHHT was originally required to fund under the terms of the Development Partnership Agreement. These comprise:

![](/img/dpafunding.png)

> * £16.8m demolition costs for the First Development Site
> * £0.8m for the demolition of Plot 18
> * £2m to underwrite the cost of Plot 18’s planning application
> * £2m to underwrite the design fees for phase 2
> * £5.5m to construct the replacement facility for Ellison House (check that the DPA says NHHT should pay for this?)

![Extract from DPA](/img/democostsdpa.png)

@. These costs are in addition to the Council’s other costs that it has already allocated to the scheme to pay for rehousing of tenants and buy back of leaseholders. In total the Council is now forecast to spend £76.7m (see para 8.14 of the AA's updated SoC) over the next five years on progressing decant and demolition, plus an additional £32.4m on the new community facilities (that were supposed to be funded by the infrastructure tarif).

@. At the previous inquiry it was established that the Acquring Authority had already spent £46m progressing the Scheme up to 2014.

@. These significant funding requirements were not envisaged at the time that the Acquiring Authority made the decision to progress the scheme. In the Sep 27 2005 report to the Executive, members were given costing estimates showing that the redevelopment would be more or less cost neutral to the Acquiring Authority over the duration of the Scheme. 

@. As a result of having to step in and fund the scheme following NHHT's refusal to continue underwriting it, the Acquiring Authority has had to make sweeping cuts to front line services. This year alone saw [cuts](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s59115/Policy%20and%20Resources%20Strategy%20201617%20to%20201819.pdf) to the Adult Care and Education budget of £39m.

@. This is in addition to the care homes and other council-owned facilities that are being sold to help fill the hole in the Acquiring Authority's budget.

![Care homes sold off under budget cuts](http://35percent.org/img/carehomesshutdown.jpg)

@. In total, the Acquiring Authority is required to absorb around £100m of central government budget cuts between now and 2019/20. In addition, it has also [estimated](https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/installing-sprinklers-southwarks-council-housing-cost-100m/) a cost of £100m to install sprinklers in its tower blocks following safety concerns arising after the Grenfell Tower disaster.

@. Compulsory purchase orders issued under Section 226(1)(a) of the TCPA are subject to S226(1A) which sets out the "wellbeing" test. This says that the Acquiring authority must not exercise the power unless it thinks that the proposed development, redevelopment or improvement is likely to achieve the promotion or improvement of the economic, social or environmental well being for its area.

@. Circular 06/2004 makes it clear that the exercise of CPO powers pursuant to this section, in terms of the benefit (or disbenefits) to be derived, need not be restricted to the land the subject of the proposed order.

@. The Objectors submit that the impact of the Scheme on the Acquiring Authority's budget as a result of funding commitments not envisaged by the AAAP, should be considered as part of the 'wellbeing' test in relation to the order; i.e. that confirmation of the order would result in harm to the social well-being of residents in the wider area, affected by the resulting budget cuts to adult care services and education, as funding is diverted away (to pay for demolition of the FDS) in order to compensate for NHHT's refusal to continue underwriting scheme costs.

## Failure to comply with AAAP rehousing objectives 
@. At the time the AAAP was adopted, it had secured funding in a partnership with the HCA to provide 1,000 new homes, 400 of which would be council owned. These would provide sufficent reprovison to rehouse tenants displaced by the first phases of the decant. 

![](/img/aaapcouncilhomes.png)

@. This would assist in achieving the AAAP's aim of rehousing 50% of existing tenants on site: _“We will accommodate approximately 50% of existing tenants through the re-provision of homes on site”_. (AAAP Policy 7.2.6)

@. The Equalities Impact Assessment supporting the AAAP also relied on this objective in order to satisfy the Acquiring Authority's Public Sector Equalities Duty (PSED).

@. The Scheme however, appears to be failing in this requirement. Of the ca. 680 tenants and leaseholders decanted from the estate to date, the only available data shows that just 34 tenants and 5 leaseholders have been rehoused in new homes on site (para 4.12 of the Acquring Authority's updated statement of case). 

|  Phase | Tenants decanted | Leaseholders decanted | Total | (Rehoused on site) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1a | ? | ?  | 53 |  |
| Site 7 | 45 | 14(3) | 59 | |
|  FDS | 544 | 22(1) | 566 |
| Phase 2 | 422(34) | ? | ||

@. The Acquiring Authority's statement of case fails to give details of how many Aylesbury tenants have been reshoused on the completed phase 1a of the Scheme. Indeed, there appears to be a general lack of evidence required to establish and measure how the rehousing requirements of the AAAP are being complied with. The Objectors understand that NHHT has commissioned a 'framework for measuring the success of the regeneration', but NHHT rejected the Objectors' request to provide this framework to the previous inquiry and has rejected [subsequent FOI requests](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/framework_for_measuring_success). The Objectors request that a full copy of this framework is provided before the inquiry. 

![Framework for measuring success of the regeneration[commissioned](http://www.social-life.co/project/Aylesbury_estate_benchmarking/) by NHHT](/img/sociallifeframework.png)

@. In 2017, the Council-run (the Acquiring Authority's Regeneration Boss is the chairman) and developer funded Creation Trust [published](https://twitter.com/creationSE17/status/859771179179102208) a 'displacement map' of tenants from the phase 2 decant:

![Creation Trust's displacement map of phase 2 tenants](/img/creationdisplacementphase2.png) 

@. The map claims contains inaccuraccies: it shows data for 410 decanted tenants from phase 2 up to March 2017, but the Acquiring Authority's [Sep 2016 Cabinet report](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s63817/Report.Aylesbury%20Regeneration%20Delivery.pdf) states that 422 tenants had been decanted from phase 2 at Sep 2016. It also claims that 'the majority of tenants remained in Walworth', but this is clearly incorrect - 34% is not a majority. 

@. Creation Trust's displacement map failed to provide information on how many tenants were rehoused in new homes on the estate. Neither did it include any information on leaseholders displacement, which is of particlar importance given so few leaseholders have been rehoused on the estate footprint. 

@. In paragraph 4.8 of its updated Statement of Case, the Acquiring Authority claims that _"All resident leaseholders from the Order Land were offered a new apartment within the new development at Site 1a. One leaseholder accepted that offer and qualified for a secure tenancy within that development."_

@. The reason that only one of the leaseholders accepted the offer of a new apartment on Site 1a is because the terms of that offer are undisputably disadvantageous; should the leaseholder actually qualify for shared equity rather than shared ownership under the Acquring Authority's 'cascade' assessment basis, then they would have been subject to a shared equity lease with the site freeholder London & Quadrant, which doesn't offer full uplift to shared equity owners. 

@. This means that when the leaseholder comes to sell the property or it is sold upon decease, then they don't receive the full capital uplift of their share. Indeed, for 2-bed properties there is no capital uplift whatsoever [see details of L&R lease here](https://halag.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/londonquadrant_sharedequity.pdf)

@. In his [evidence](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/Mark_Maginn.pdf) to the site 7 CPO inquiry, Mark Maginn explains that leaseholders are assessed for rehousing on a 'cascade' assessment basis; i.e. they are assessed to see if they can afford shared ownership before being considered for shared equity or other rehousing options. Given that shared ownership is much less attractive and more costly than shared equity, it is no surprise that only circa 10 of the (circa 110?) leaseholders decanted to date have qualified for and taken up shared equity.

## Compensation issues
@. The Acquiring Authority has argued that the Objectors' argument that leaseholders are being forced out of the area because the compensation receive is insufficent, is a valuation issue which should be dealt with instead by the Upper Tribunal. 

@. However, the Acquiring Authority openly acknowledges that the compensation levels are insufficient:

>"It is acknowledged that the market value compensation for properties on the Estate is sometimes insufficient to buy outright a comparable non-Estate property in the area" (update SoC, para 5.5)

>"Addressing the needs of longstanding resident leaseholders is important as they have particular difficulties in finding new homes, as in general the value of their property is lower than other similar sized properties in the borough." (Paragraph 4.2.1.12 of the DPA Business Plan)

>"The council’s ownership schemes were in recognition of the fact that the price offered might not enable a leaseholder to buy another property." ([minutes of 10/03/2014 Overview and Scrutiny Committee](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/mgAi.aspx?ID=32015))

>"Some  Councils  offer  equivalent  exchange  whereby  a  leaseholder  swops his/her property for another of the same value.  This has been considered but the properties being regenerated in this Borough tend to be at the lowest level of the value scale. There are unlikely to be similar equivalents that aren’t part of regeneration schemes so such an offer would be hollow." ([OSC Committee report 10/03/14](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s44932/Officer%20Report%20-%20Comparison%20of%20Discretionary%20Assistance%20Given%20to%20Resident%20Leaseholders.pdf))

Given that the Acquiring Authority acknowledges that the compensation payable is insufficient for leaseholders to remain in the area. It follows that the rehousing options on offer are critical in determining whether or not leaseholders' human rights have been sufficiently safeguarded. In particular those rehousing options on offer at the time the AAAP was adopted (i.e. the like-for-like swap option subseqently withdrawn) and upon which its Equalities Impact Assessment was based.

## Failure to supply sufficient evidence
In its 10 May letter to the Acquiring Authority, the DCLG wrote: _"It is important that those whose interest or rights are included in the order should be in a position to put their case at the inquiry without having to probe for further details. If they have to do this during the inquiry, they may not be in a position to deal with the additional information and this could lead to a request for an adjournment."_

@. In order to avoid a 'probe for further details' and possible adjournment required if we have to do this at the time of the inquiry, the Objectors request that the following information is provided at the Acquiring Authority's earliest convenience and in any case at least 28 working days before commencement of the inquiry:

 * The viability assessment submitted in conjunction with the revised planning application.
 * The signed section 106 agreement (or signed variations to the existing section 106 agreement as the case may be) in relation to the revised planning application.
 * Part 2 of Schedule 1 of the DPA describes a 'Steering Group' to _"monitor and provide a forum to discuss the performance of the parties’ obligations under"_ the DPA. It holds quarterly meetings and an 'Annual Business Plan Review. Please provide a copy of all minutes from these meetings (required to be recorded by NHHT under paragraph 2.16) since the start of 2015. 
 * A copy of the framework to measure the success of the Scheme commissioned by NHHT and referred to in paragraph xx. (Our request to be provide this to the previous inquiry was not complied with) 
 * The most recent 'Risk Log' for the Scheme submitted in accordance with the requirements of section 13 of the DPA Business Plan. (_"13.2.1: It is intended that the risk log will be a live document and updated regularly throughout the Project"_).
 * The stock condition survey referred to in paragraph 25 of [this May 2011 Cabinet report](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s19609/Report%20Housing%20investment%20programme%20and%20revised%20strategy.pdf), (which the Acquiring Authority failed to provide to the previous inquiry despite our request months in advance)
 * Full details of how many tenants and leaseholders have been decanted to date and where they have been displaced to. (including a breakdown of how many decanted from each phase and how many rehoused on site, plus details of whether secure tenants or temporary licencees). 
 * Details of elderly leaseholder on the order land, Mr Crossfield (28 Arklow, London SE17 2BJ) who it is understood deceased at the beginning of this year. Had Mr Crossfield's rehousing application been rejected? Was his death connected with any incident on the order land or disconnection of services? (i.e. heating/hot water/electricity - given that the Arklow block is adjacent to the demolition works)
 * Full details of the two leaseholders who supposedly took up NHHT's shared equity offer (and contractual commitment) to purchase and repair 5 street properties.
 * Details of whether NHHT has complied with its contractual obligation to provide 35 social rent units by 2017 from its existing stock for the rehousing of Aylesbury tenants (see paras 4.2.2.2 and 4.2.3.4 of the DPA Business Plan section 4).
 * Full details of the Acquiring Authority's audit conducted in accordance with the Ombudsman's directions (ref:16005626) concerning monitoring of compliance with section 106 requirements.
 * Clarification is sought on whether NHHT's development partner (Barratt Homes) has withdrawn from its involvement in the Scheme. If so, please provide details of any replacement development partner and copies of any agreements with them.
 * Paragraph 7.11 of the Acquiring Authority's updated Statement of Case claims that there will be a gain in affordable housing floorspace on the FDS of 3,232sqm. The Objectors dispute this figure (we calculate net loss of 24,707sqm) and seek clarification of how it has been calculated.
 * Paragraph 10.9 of the Acquiring Authority's updated Statement of Case says: _"The Council has kept and continues to keep detailed records about the owners and occupiers of the interests in the Order Land."_ The Objectors request that copies of these 'detailed records' are provided before the inquiry commences (with personal information redacted if necessary).
 * Full details of the location and number of dwellings on the estate that currently meet/fail Decent Homes Standard.

 * Submit copy of the [2009 Leaseholders Toolkit](http://35percent.org/img/ToolkitAylesburyLeaseholders2009.pdf) showing the like-for-like property swap option.
 * Ensure that a copy of the 2006 leaseholder rehousing policy with details of the like-for-like options is either already in the core bundle or submitted for inclusion.
 * Submit copy of [this letter to a Site 7 leaseholder](http://35percent.org/img/hilmisharedownership.pdf) in which he is arbitrarily informed that he doesn't qualify for shared equity, only shared ownership (this is evindence of the AA's arbitrary 'cascade' rehousing eligibility assessment procedures)
 * Submit copy of [Letter to Site 7 leaseholders](http://35percent.org/img/lettersenttowolvertonleaseholders.pdf) with the Acquiring Authority warning that re-housing offers will be withdrawn once CPO procedures start (evidence of failure to take reasonable steps to negotiate by agreement).

## Conclusion
@. In summary, the Acquiring Authority's decision to pursue compulsory purchase powers instead of negotiating with the Objectors is oppressive. The remaining leaseholders have shown themselves to be reasonable and dignified people who have continued to engage constructively. Their demands are reasonable: the Acquiring Authority should either replace their homes in a swap for another of its properties elsewhere in the borough or pay the market value for homes as determined by the independent RICS valuers that they have instructed. 

@. The Compulsory Purchase Code requires the Acquiring Authority to make a 'compelling case' in the public interest for compulsory purchase powers to be used. For the reasons outlined in this Statement of Case it has failed to do so and has failed the 'wellbeing' test; as such the order should not be confirmed. The Objectors add that non-conformation of the order will not result in the end of the Acquiring Authority's scheme as has been implied; it will simply mean that the Acquiring Authority will have to rehouse remaining leaseholders using the option promised to them at the time the AAAP was agreed (like-for-like swap).

## Alternative location for the Scheme
@. Paragraph 16(iv) of the ODPM 06/04 lists factors which the Secretary of State should consider in determining whether to confirm the order:

>"whether the purpose for which the acquiring authority is proposing to acquire the land could be achieved by any other means. This may include considering the appropriateness of any alternative proposals put forward by the owners of the land, or any other persons, for its re-use. __It may also involve examining the suitability of any alternative locations for the purpose for which the land is being acquired.__"

@. The Objectors submit that that there is an alternative location, just several hundred metres from the order land that would provide a much greater increase in density that was one of the main objectives of the development plan; the St James estate. This is approximately the same area as the order land but contains just 100 low rise, low quality, energy inefficient homes. 

@. Compulsory purchase powers would not be required because NHHT owns the freehold of all the homes, which it lets privately on short-term lets and where it can [evict residents](https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/housing-association-slammed-nightmare-scenario-eviction-threat-bermondseys-st-james-estate/) without the need for compulsory purchase orders.

@. Not only would the development of this site provide a much greater density uplift but it would also achieve the AAAP's objective of providing a more mixed community, given that the existing housing is exclusively private market rent.

## Alternative refurbishment scheme (notes) 
@. Work out how much AA receives in rental income from tenants on the estate. Say it should use this on refurb/maintenance 

@. Paragraph 1.2.4 of the AAAP says that the estate needs to be redeveloped because "it would cost too much to bring the homes up to decent homes standard".

@. Quote from the Housing Commission HINES estates data showing only half of estate's homes fail to meet DHS.

@. [This report](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s56449/Report%20Major%20works%20status%20report%20incorporating%20Warm%20Dry%20and%20Safe.pdf) describes different funding for DHS works, including the 'GLA Backlog fund' and the [accompanying appendices](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s56450/Appendices%201%20-%204%20Major%20works%20status%20report%20incorporating%20Warm%20Dry%20and%20Safe.pdf) show that the Four Squares estate (a High Investment Needs estate) was brought up to DHS for just £12m. Work out how much this is per unit and also show similar comparables.

@. On the question of sources of funding a refurb scheme, one could also include the Section 106 off-site pooled funding and that set aside for new Council homes. Refurbishment would also help the Council save on the [£10m per year it is having to spend on temporary accommodation](https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/council-spend-temporary-housing-now-five-times-20112012/):

@. [This Cabinet item](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieIssueDetails.aspx?IId=11030&Opt=3) from 2011 gives details of 'High Investment Needs estates' and gives cost estimates of DHS works. 

@. Appendix 6 of the Cabinet item shows the Aylesbury as not being the most costly of the estates. We could find out the actual costs of other estates on the list and do a comparison. Here's the [link to appendix 6](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s19628/Appendix%206%20List%20of%2015%20High%20Investment%20Needs%20Estates.pdf)

@. Southwark has in any case already [committed £12.5m to Major Works](http://35percent.org/img/Aylesbury-Phase-2-newsletter-February-2017-JH.pdf) bringing homes on phase 3/4 of the estate up to Decent Homes Standard.

@. An alternative scheme (referred to as ‘Plan B’ in the Statement of Reasons for making the CPO) has been promoted by a group of local stakeholders, using the acronym xxx. The scheme proposed by xxx is clearly superior to that of the Acquiring Authority. It would require less funding, would be less intrusive and would meet the Acquiring Authority’s objective of achieving an improved.

@. The Acquiring Authority is [spending £380k per dwelling](http://www.estatesgazette.com/blogs/london-residential-research/2015/07/costs-southwark-council-528149-build-council-flat/) on building new Council homes (not even including land acquisition costs) - it is spending £49m this year alone on building new council homes (see Budget Book 2016/17). The Objectors submit that this would be better spent on refurbishment at £xx,xxx per dwelling.

@. Last year the Acquiring Authority spent £14.2m purchasing homes from developers on the open market to use as council housing. The Objectors submit that these funds would be better used refurbishing the dwellings on the order land.

@. The AAAP envisaged redevelopment because at the time it said that: _"it would cost too much to bring the homes up to decent homes standards"_. It asserted that redevlopement would also enable an uplift in density to 4200 new homes and that these would be of better quality in terms of environment and sustainability. Given that the scheme fails to conform with these objectives and given the significant number of homes brought up to DHS in the interim, the Objectors submit that refurbishment would be a more economically efficent and socially equitable option. 

@. Council has spent £46m redeveloping just 112 homes on the estate to date and has allocated £96m to the Scheme over next five years alone. How many homes could be refurbished with £96m based on the 2005 refurb costings adjusted for inflation?

@. In 2012, the Acquiring Authority spent several million pounds on fire safety works at the Aylesbury estate. This was carried out following a fire in one of its tower blocks in Peckham (Lakanal House) and a borough-wide fire safety review.

@. The Objectors note that the existing buildings on the estate have not been wrapped in flammable cladding and all benefit from at least two stairwells, which was not the case in the recent Grenfell Tower incident. The same cannot be said for the proposed tall buildings on the FDS, which only propose one single stairwell (check this?).

@. The Acquiring Authority has intimated that there are structural problems with the 5 and 6 storey blocks on the estate. However, the Alan Conisbee report on which this is based recommended removal of mains gas from these blocks and it is understood that these blocks now comply with BRE safety standards as a result. If this is not the case then the Acquiring Authority will need to explain why it has continued to house families in these blocks for the past 12 years if they are structurally unsound.
