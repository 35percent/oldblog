## The Scheme for the Order Land is no longer in accordance with the statutory development plan
@. A key requirement of the compulsory purchase code is that the Scheme underlying the Order must conform with the requirements of the statutory development plan. Paragraph 76 of the [06/04 ODPM Circular](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/compulsory-purchase-and-the-crichel-down-rules-circular-06-2004) lists a key consideration as _"whether the purpose for which the land is being acquired fits in with the adopted Local Plan for the area"_ and specifies that _"any programme of land assembly needs to be set within a clear strategic framework, and this will be particularly important when demonstrating the justification for acquiring land compulsorily under section 226(1)(a) powers as a means of furthering the well-being of the wider area."_.

@. The adopted Local Plan for the Scheme underlying this Order (“the Scheme”) is the [Aylesbury Area Action Plan 2010](http://www.2.southwark.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/13132/aylesbury_area_action_plan_2010_inc_appendices) (“AAAP”) [CD2], which was adopted in January 2010 as part of the Acquiring Authority's local development framework.

@. As a result of the [withdrawal of £180m government funding](http://www.2.southwark.gov.uk/news/article/159/government_to_withdraw_pfi_funding_for_aylesbury) envisaged by the AAAP and subsequent changes in housing policy affecting the viability of the Scheme, it now fails to comply with the following requirements of the development plan:

 * Minimum number of new homes requirements
 * Net loss of affordable housing requirements
 * Dwelling size requirements
 * Minimum space standards
 * Tenure requirements
 * Renewable Energy requirements
 * Building Heights requirements
 * Sunlight/Daylight requirements
 * Open Space requirements
 * Transport/public realm requirements
 * Private Amenity Space requirements
 * Dual aspect design requirements
 * Privacy and overlooking requirements
 * Play Space requirements
 * Mixed use/Retail requirements
 * Density requirements
 * Monitoring and compliance 
 * Infrastructure/public sector funding requirements
 * Rehousing/PSED mitigation requirements
 
## Minimum number of new homes requirements
@. The AAAP said that the scheme would deliver 4,200 new homes - a net uplift of 1,450 over the existing estate. The @AAAP said that this would help contribute to and conform with the London Plan requirement of 16,300 new homes by 2016/2017.

@. Paragraph 88 of the [planning committee report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!Vbu5QpckfYCnJrulzlWyuQ%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) for the outline application re-iterates that _"A key objective of the AAAP (Policy BH1 Number of homes) is to increase the number of homes on the estate"_. The Scheme underlying the order as it stands will fail to achieve this objective.

@. Appendix 5 of the AAAP specifies how many homes need to be delivered in each phase to achieve the 1,450 uplift in number of homes. It specifies a requirement for 425 new homes on (completed) phases 1a/site 7 but only 408 were provided. It also requires 880 new homes on the FDS, but the consented plans are to provide only 830 new homes.

![AAAP Appendix 5](http://35percent.org/img/aaapapp5.png)

@. The Acquiring Authority may argue that NHHT is submitting a revised planning application for the FDS (see paragraph 7.2 of its Statement of Case), but this will only increase the overall number of homes by 10 to 840. There still remains a significant shortfall.

@. The shortfall between the minimum number of homes guaranteed in the planning consent for remaining outline phases and the number required by the AAAP is much greater. Given that the FDS Scheme was approved in conjunction with the outline phases and shares the same section 106 agreement, the outline Scheme is inseperable from the FDS Scheme.

@. The Outline planning application sought consent to build a *minimum* of 1,700 new homes and *maximum* of 2,745 across the outline Scheme. It is understood that some flexibility may be required in an outline application, but there is no explanation as to why NHHT required such a significant amount of flexibility (1000 homes). The Outline application for the neighbouring Heygate estate regeneration (2,700 new homes) gave a flexibility between min and max provision of just 200 homes. 

@. The minimum specification of 1,700 homes is well below the AAAP requirement of 2,898 homes across the Outline phases and would result in the provision of just 2,948 new homes across all phases (1,700 plus 408 on completed phases plus 840 on FDS) - well short of the 4,200 required and an uplift of just 200 homes on the estate baseline[^2]. 

@. If the order is confirmed then there is nothing preventing NHHT delivering the Scheme according to the minimum specification, thereby failing to comply with key objective AAAP (Policy BH1 Increasing the Number of Homes). 

### Net loss of affordable housing requirements
@. The [planning committee report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!Vbu5QpckfYCnJrulzlWyuQ%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) for the Outline Scheme acknowledges that if NHHT builds to the *minimum* specification, then _"the outline minimum scenario would result in a net loss of -559 affordable dwellings or -1542 affordable habitable rooms"_ (para. 98). It acknowledges that this would fail to comply with the London Plan requirements on net loss of affordable housing and the AAAP's requirement that there would only be a small net loss of affordable housing (150 dwellings). It will also result in the provision of just 1,634 affordable dwellings (210 in the completed phases, plus 560 in the revised FDS application, plus 864 affordable units in the consented Outline minimum specification). This falls well short of the 2,100 affordable housing dwellings required by the AAAP: 

![Extract from the AAAP](http://35percent.org/img/aaapnetloss.png)

@. In response to the shortcomings in NHHT's minimum proposed specification, the planning committee report goes on to explain (emphasis added):

>"with Phase 1A and Site 7 in place, and assuming that the FDS scheme is delivered in line with the current application, then an additional 4790 habitable rooms of affordable housing **in phases 2, 3 and 4** would be required to deliver full replacement of the baseline." (para. 101)

>"The applicant has therefore confirmed that they will commit to provide 50% of all habitable rooms as affordable housing, in line with AAAP policy BH3, or a minimum of 4790 habitable rooms of affordable housing **under the outline application**, whichever is the greater. This would ensure future phases will secure full replacement affordable housing, when measured by habitable rooms. This will be secured by a legal agreement along with a site wide affordable housing delivery strategy that will **set milestones for the required number of affordable habitable rooms on a phase by phase basis.**" (paras 102/103)

@. However, the section 106 legal agreement failed to secure these minimum requirements. It failed to set any _"milestones for the required number of affordable habitable rooms on a phase by phase basis"_ and failed to require _"a minimum of 4790 habitable rooms of affordable housing **under the outline application**"_. The provisions of the section 106 agreement instead required a minimum of 4790 affordable habitable rooms on the Outline Development **OR** 50% of all habitable rooms as affordable housing **accross the FDS and the Outline applications combined - whichever is the greater**.

![Extract from S106 agreement](http://35percent.org/img/minimumhr.png)

![Extract from S106 agreement](http://35percent.org/img/dpadevelopmentdefinition.png)

@. This subtle but significant change of wording enables NHHT to build a minimum of 4791 affordable habitable rooms across the FDS and Outline Schemes combined, as long as this represents 50% of the total housing across the sites.

@. As a result of the Acquiring Authority's failure to properly negotiate the minimum affordable housing requirement, and its failure to secure any minimum affordable housing requirement in its DPA with NHHT, if the order is confirmed it or (any other developer it may choose to assign the planning consent to (check this?)), will be able to build the Scheme out to the minimum specification and there will be nothing the Acquiring Authority can do to stop it. Note also the Acquiring Authority's failure to action against NHHT when it breached the terms of the section 106 agreement for the Bermondsey Spa regeneration.

@. The Acquiring Authority may argue that the section 106 provision governing the minimum affordable housing requirement should be interpreted according to its intention. 

@. However, NHHT's intention and interpretation of the provision is clear; its [June 2016 Housing Delivery Strategy](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!GB0ybg40uhtGW5vcbWkuZA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) submitted pursuant to the requirements of the s106 agreement, clearly show how it has combined both the FDS and the outline Schemes within the minimum 4790 affordable habitable rooms requirement:

![](http://35percent.org/img/housingdeliverystrategy.png)

@. A further loophole in the section 106 agreement's affordable housing provisions, can be found in the definition of habitable room for the purposes of calculation the min affordable housing provison. This allows any room larger than 27.5m2 to be counted as two habitable rooms for affordable housing provision. 

![Extract from S106 agreement](http://35percent.org/img/aylesburyoutlinehr.png)

@. The Acquiring Authority may argue that the FDS Scheme should be regarded in isolation from the Outline Scheme (and the above loophole around habitable room calculation) because the section 106 agreement provides a schedule (Schedule 4) setting out the minimum number of affordable housing units to be provided on the FDS.

@. The Objectors submit that the Outline Scheme should not be seen in isolation because ...  and that in any event there will still be a significant net loss of affordable housing **floorspace** on the FDS if the schedule 4 of the section 106 agreement is complied with. 

@. Policy 3.14 of the London Plan resists the loss of affordable housing, without equivalent replacement (emphasis added): 

>"3.14B: Loss of housing, including affordable housing, should be resisted unless the housing is replaced at existing or higher densities with **at least equivalent floorspace**. 

>"3.82 ESTATE RENEWAL:  Where redevelopment of affordable housing is proposed, it should not be permitted unless it is replaced by better quality accommodation, providing **at least an equivalent floorspace** of affordable housing."

@. The London Plan is very clear that net loss of affordable housing is resisted and should be calculated in terms of **floorspace**.

@. The GLA stage 1 report for the outline site says that comprehensive floorspace figures for the Aylesbury estate are not available. However, paragraph 353 of the FDS planning committee report confirms that _"The total existing floorspace on the FDS equates to approximately 54,747sqm"_. 

![Extract from the [planning committee report for the FDS](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!JwAZWYwclvfEhXaN8JmiPA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d)](http://35percent.org/img/fdsbaseline.png)

@. Using the schedule of accommodation in paragraph 94 of the planning committee report combined with the table of room sizes in paragraph 5.2 of the revised affordable housing statement, the total proposed affordable housing floorspace is 28,293sqm. This shows a net reduction of affordable housing floorspace of 24,707 - more than half of the existing affordable floorspace.   

| Unit type | tenure | Quantity | Sqm | Total sqm |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 Bed | Social rent | 135 | 52.3 sqm | 7,060 sqm |
| 2 Bed | Social rent | 68 | 66 sqm | 4,488 sqm |
| 3 Bed | Social rent | 63 | 96 sqm | 6,048 sqm |
| 4 Bed | Social rent | 20 | 99 sqm | 1,980 sqm |
| 5 Bed | Social rent | 18 | 128 sqm | 2,304 sqm |
| 1 Bed | Intermediate | 37 | 50 sqm | 1,850 sqm |
| 2 Bed | Intermediate | 48 | 63 sqm | 3,024 sqm |
| 3 Bed | Intermediate | 15 | 89 sqm | 1,335 sqm |
| 4 Bed | Intermediate | 20 | 99 sqm | 2,204 sqm |
|  | |  |  | 30,293 sqm |

@. The Acquiring Authority is claiming that the Mayor’s Housing SPG says that the re-provision of housing may be considered in terms of units numbers and/or habitable rooms. However the SPG only says that this is permissible in relation to family homes (emphasis added):

>"5.1.14 Calculations of whether there is a loss of affordable or overall housing provision can be made on the basis of habitable rooms rather than dwellings, where the redevelopment of an estate is providing a housing mix more appropriate to the needs of both existing and prospective future residents – for example where there is increased provision of dwellings for larger households."

@. Given the proposed Scheme's shortcomings in relation to the objectives and requirements of the AAAP, the Objectors submit that the Scheme is not _"providing a housing mix more appropriate to the needs of both existing and prospective future residents"_ - for example, the Scheme fails to provide _"increased provision of dwellings for larger households"_. This is addressed in the following section explaining the Scheme's failure to comply with the AAAP's dwelling size requirements.

@. The Objectors also note that NHHT's failure to ensure that there is no net loss of affordable housing may present a barrier to it receiving funding for the redevelopment. The Mayor's [funding agreement](http://35percent.org/img/standardformagreement2017.pdf) requires all estate regeneration schemes funded by his programme to comply with his [Good Practice Guide to Estate Regeneration](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/draftgoodpracticeestateregenerationguidedec16v2.pdf):

![Extract from the Mayor's [funding agreement](http://35percent.org/img/standardformagreement2017.pdf)](http://35percent.org/img/standardformer.png)

@. The Mayor's [Good Practice Guide](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/draftgoodpracticeestateregenerationguidedec16v2.pdf) in turn, states that _"demolition should only be followed where it does not result in a loss of social housing"_. 

## Dwelling size requirements
@. The AAAP says _"There will be a significant proportion of family homes with 23% houses, together with all the facilities needed by families, to make sure that the whole area is family-friendly."_

@. Appendix 5 of the AAAP sets out the required number of unit sizes per phase:

![](http://35percent.org/img/aaapapp5.png)

@. Of the 60 3-bed dwellings required by the AAAP on completed phases 1a/site 7 - only 30 were provided. The AAAP requires 149 3-bed dwellings on the FDS but only consented 108. The AAAP requires 38 4-bed dwellings but only 32 were in the planning consent. (We will need to check what dwelling sizes are proposed in the revised FDS application)

@. The shortfalls in the family homes required by the AAAP are far more severe on the Outline scheme under the minimum specification.

@. Paragraph 93 of the planning committee report for the Outline Scheme shows that the minimum specification would result in the reprovision of just 263 'social rented' family homes (3-bed and above). This compares with 776 social rented family units on the existing Outline site right now (874 listed in the S106 Heads of Terms for Outline and FDS combined, minus 98 social rented family homes on FDS). 

@. This will prevent the requirements of paragraph 7.2.6 of the AAAP being satisfied: _“We will accommodate approximately 50% of existing tenants through the re-provision of homes on site”._

@. The AAAP says that:

![Extract from the AAAP](http://35percent.org/img/aaapsizeofhomes.png) 

@. The Sustainability Assessment for the AAAP says: 

>"A recent Housing Needs Survey (2003) for Southwark identified 35,851 households stating a need to move in the next 5 years. Of those households, 48% stated the main reason for needing to move was that their home was too small and 54.3% needed a home with 3 or more bedrooms.

>"The revised tenure mix new option was chosen as it minimises the loss of affordable housing and will help develop a mixed and sustainable community. It will also ensure that the rehousing needs of existing tenants are met."



## Minimum space standards
Paragraph 124 of the planning committee report for the Outline Scheme acknowledges that _"Since the AAAP was adopted, space standards have increased with the introduction of minimum dwellings sizes in the  London Plan (2011) and the adoption of the Southwark Plan Residential Design SPD (2011). The result is that the minimum space standards in the AAAP have been superseded by larger space standards in these more recent documents."_

@. The London Plan's minimum space requirements are as follows:

![](/img/londonplanminspace.png)

@. The Outline Scheme's Affordable Housing Statement provides a breakdown of the minimum sizes of the social rented and intermediate affordable housing units:

![](/img/outlineminsize.png)

What about the private units?



@. Say something here about the intention of the AAAP to create a family-oriented redevelopment to address the needs of existing families on the estate...
 
-----

@. Para 116 of the [outline officers report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!Vbu5QpckfYCnJrulzlWyuQ%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) says something about four person two beds and the s106.

## Tenure requirements
@. The AAAP requires 37. 5% of all new homes to be social rented tenure. The AAAP was adopted before the introduction of the incoming Tory government's new Affordable Rent tenure. 

@. It is understood that NHHT is funding the social rented homes on the FDS with a grant from the GLA's Affordable Housing Programme 2016-2021. The GLA's [funding agreement](http://35percent.org/img/standardformagreement2017.pdf) for this programme does not provide for social rent. Instead it offers funding for a tenure named 'London Affordable Rent' (LAR). The funding agreement makes it clear that this effectively the Affordable Rent tenure and subject to regulations and legislation governing Affordable Rent:

![Extract from the Mayor's [funding agreement](http://35percent.org/img/standardformagreement2017.pdf)](http://35percent.org/img/rentstandardpara.png)

@. Furthermore, the funding agreement prescribes a specific formula for how LAR rent levels are to be set:

![Extract from the Mayor's [funding agreement](http://35percent.org/img/standardformagreement2017.pdf)](http://35percent.org/img/larformula.png)

@. This formula conflicts with the formula for the setting of social rents prescribed in the Rent Standard Guidance and will result in LAR rents increasing proportionally by more than social rents year on year. LAR tenure is not social rented tenure required by the AAAP, it is subject to different regulation and legislation (enabling fixed-term rather than secure tenancies, pay to stay, etc). 

@. It is also noted that NHHT's revised planning applications for the FDS now include the provision of 'market rent' rather than private for-sale housing. This is a breach of the AAAP's tenure requirements, which specifically state 'private homes'. Homes rented on short-term tenancies by a housing association at market rent are not interchangeable with private for-sale homes; they are two separate types of tenure for planning purposes (check this?).


### Renewable energy requirements
@ . Sustainable development was one of the core principles of the development plan. Policy BH6([I] - ENERGY SUPPLY) of the AAAP requires new developments in the core action area to be serviced by one centralised energy plant:

>"The energy supply for the action area core will be generated by combined heat and power (CHP). The CHP plant should be part of an energy centre located immediately south of the junction of Thurlow Street and Inville Road and appropriately sized to accommodate plant required to deliver services to the development. The redevelopment of the action area core will result in zero carbon growth. All developments within the action area core must connect to the CHP system. Developments completed prior to the implementation of CHP should be designed so that they can switch to the CHP once it is available." 

@. Policy BH6([II] - USE OF RENEWABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES) envisaged that the CHP plant would be fuelled by renewable energy (biomass) and required developments completed prior to be fuelled by a minimum 20% __on-site__ renewable energy:

>"Developments should meet the London Plan target of a 20% reduction in CO2 emissions through the use of renewable technologies. Until such time as the CHP is fuelled by renewable energy sources and is capable of meeting the London Plan target, we will require developments to use their own CHP compatible on-site renewable energy technologies.
 
@. Paragraph 6.3.3 of the the AAAP's Sustainability Assessment explains the vision futher:

>"New developments will also need to reduce carbon emissions by 20% using carbon renewable technologies. Currently, the most feasible way of doing this would appear to be by providing biomass CHP in the energy centre."

@. However, the Scheme falls short of these requirements in that the biomass plans have been dropped and the development on the order land will be serviced by its own separate individual (non-renewable) gas-fired CHP plant, which will have the 'potential' to be connected to the proposed energy centre on Thurlow St, but won't be serviced by it. This is acknowledged in the planning committee report for the FDS application, which says:

>"Whilst the AAAP envisaged a single energy centre being provided, the proposal is for an Energy Centre within Block 5 of the FDS with another energy centre being located close to the Albany Road/Thurlow Street junction as part of the Outline Scheme."

@. Justification for shelving the biomass plans is given in the FDS planning application's Revised Energy Strategy which says:

>"Site specific analysis for Solar Thermal, Biomass Heating, Wind turbines and Heat Pumps are shown in Appendix A as they are not recommended for the site. This applies to both the Detailed and Outline application at this stage."

>Appendix A - "BIOMASS HEATING: This technology is not recommended due to additional air quality concerns involved when including this technology in an urban area. This fuel source is also not considered for CHP as a larger scale of plant is required before this is suitable. The additional burden of fuel storage and delivery would also hamper development."  

@. The planning committee report for the application acknowledges that the Scheme _"falls far short"_ of complying even with the 20% minimum on-site renewable energy requirement:

>"Photovoltaic panels are proposed for the areas of roof that will achieve enough sunshine tomake them viable. Currently this stands at 697sqm. It is acknowledged that this represents a small proportion of the available roof space across the FDS however, as a result of the townscape requirements that sought taller buildings on the park edge with heights reducing incrementally northwards, much of the remaining roof space is overshadowed by the taller elements to the south. The proposed photovoltaic panels will achieve a 3.72% carbon dioxide saving and whilst it is accepted that this falls far short of the 20% target it is accepted that this is an ambitious target to meet in a highly urbanised area." (Paragraph 365)

@. The 20% minimum on-site renewable energy requirement is not just a requirement of the AAAP, it is also a requirement of both the AA's strategic planning framework [(Core Strategy)](http://www.2.southwark.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/13131/core_strategy_2011) and the London Plan.

@. Policy 3.6.1 of the AAAP requires the Scheme to result in 'zero carbon growth':

>"The development will be designed to result in zero carbon growth, that is, no net growth in carbon dioxide emissions despite an increase in the number of dwellings. This will require buildings which are highly energy efficient."

@. The Acquiring Authority has produced no evidence that the Scheme complies with this requirement of the AAAP.

@. The planning consent for the order land fails to comply with any of these policies, which are a core objective of the development plan. The Objectors have submitted a [sample](http://35percent.org/img/aylesburynewvsoldepc.pdf) of Energy Performance Certificates (EPC) showing that, despite not having double glazing installed, the existing dwellings on the order land are more energy efficient than the Aylesbury new-build apartments on the neighbouring completed phase 1a of the Scheme (Roffo Court).

![New-build EPC (left) existing Aylesbury estate (right)](http://35percent.org/img/epcomparison.png)

@. The EPC certificates for completed phase 1a of the Scheme confirm that it does not benefit from any renewable energy sources. Futher [documentation](http://35percent.org/img/Totters_Court.pdf) shows that the development is fuelled by a central gas boiler. 

@. This is a breach of the planning consent for phase 1a; the [planning committee report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!EBAeY2lWKnBCMyOrbAnyPA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) for the development says that it will be fuelled by a central biomass CHP:

![Extract from the phase 1a planning committee report](http://35percent.org/img/biomassboilerproposed.png)

@. Here is an extract from the [planning officer report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!ZjnzKbe5kK9g1qbkCkoQdQ%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) for a subsequent application to install the biomass boiler and thereby discharge the requirement.

![Extract from officer report re- application to discharge biomass requirement](http://35percent.org/img/phase1abiomass.png)

@. The Acquiring Authority may attempt to argue that a new planning application is currently being prepared, but the Objectors point out that it is very unlikely that this will meet the more stringent zero carbon policies introduced since the original 2014 planning consent was granted. 

@. In March 2016, The Mayor of London set out the approach to achieving the London Plan policy aim of 'zero carbon homes' for major developments in the Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (SPG), published in March 2016.

![Policy 5.2b of the London Plan](http://35percent.org/img/lpextractzerocarbon.png)

@. Policy 3.6.7 of the AAAP envisaged this requirement for zero carbon homes: _"The government has announced the intention of ensuring that all homes are CfSH Level 6 by 2016. Proposals will need to comply with these regulations where these are more stringent than CfSH Level 4."_ 

---
@. The section 106 agreement only requires a minimum 3% renewable energy across the FDS and outline scheme:

![](http://35percent.org/img/renewablesrequirement.png)

## Public realm and sunlight/daylight requirements
@. It was pointed out during the previous inquiry that the tall buildings (market units) running east to west along the frontage to Burgess Park, will result in a significant number of homes in the affordable blocks behind them failing to meet BRE minimum daylight requirements.

@. This was taken up by the inspector at the previous inquiry and the criticisms outlined in detail in paragraphs 368-370 of her report do not need repeating. The planning committee report also openly acknowledges the Scheme's shortcomings in relation to daylight requirements:

>"It is acknowledged that failure to achieve full compliance with BRE guidance for minimum ADF levels is a less positive aspect of the proposal" (paragraph 139)   

@. Paragraph A6.6.3.7 says that _"Tall buildings should achieve some visual separation from adjacent developments."_

@. Policy PL4 says that there should be two tall buildings on the order land ranging from 10-15 storeys, but the consented plans show three tall buildings along the Albany Road frontage, ranging from 14 to 20 storeys.

@. Policy PL4 also says: "The design of these taller buildings needs careful consideration. They should be elegant and slender. Proposals should demonstrate that harmful effects on residents, pedestrians and cyclists, such as overshadowing and wind funnelling, will be minimised.

@. Paragraph 5.223 of NHHT's planning statement explains that one of the reasons for the sunlight/daylight failure is because _"the development proposes the tall buildings along the park boundary to maximise the number of apartments with a view of the park"._

@. Policy A6.5.5 of the AAAP provides some mitigation for the impact of the tall blocks:

>"The frontage along Burgess Park must include a strong building line, allow for a range of heights and massing and include excellent architectural design. The park front should be designed to allow for light into rear courtyards and allow for views and glimpses from the park into the areas beyond the immediate front."

@. Policy A6.5.7 envisages that this will be achieved using a series of 'green fingers' - _"a series of multi-functional spaces that link with Burgess Park"_ : 


>"A series of ‘green fingers’ will be created, extending from Burgess Park into the action area core interlinking the park with the development. Their predominant function is that of a public space with social interaction, pedestrian and cycle movement dominating."

![Extract from the AAAP's Visual Impact Assessment](http://35percent.org/img/visualimpactassessment.png)

@. Besides enabling daylight, the AAAP envisages that the green fingers will _"provide an important part of the overall public open space in the AAP area. They will extend Burgess Park into the residential development, allowing people to move easily from their homes to the park. They will also enable many more homes to have a frontage along pleasant green spaces. The green fingers will provide a range of functions including children’s play areas, water management and pedestrian and cycle movement."_ (policy 4.2.6)

![Extract from the AAAP](http://35percent.org/img/greenfingerintersections.png)

@. The green fingers also enable several key 'green links' envisaged by the AAAP, which link neighbouring local parks to Burgess Park.

![Extract from AAAP](http://35percent.org/img/networkofgreenspaces.png)
@. The AAAP diagram for the order land shows one of the green fingers dissecting the FDS (10) and a second open space, Westmoreland Plaza (9) on the north-west corner of the order land.

![Extract from AAAP](http://35percent.org/img/fdsgreenfingers.png)

@. However, the planning application for the FDS Scheme and masterplan failed to include the green fingers and Westmoreland Plaza reduced in size such that it is now described in the planning documents as a 'pocket park'. 

![Extract from Design & Access Statement [CD43]](http://35percent.org/img/fdsmodel.jpg)

@. The removal of the green fingers from the Scheme, means that the propsals for the order land will now suffer from the very problems that the AA has attributed to the estate in its grounds for redevelopment - lack of permeability, dark alleyways etc and will not enable the AAAP's objective of creating better quality open space/public realm. Moreover, the consented scheme will result in a significant net loss of open space.

 
## Sunlight to amenity spaces
@. Paragraphs 154 to 162 of The planning committee report for the FDS say:

>"BRE guidance recommends that for outdoor amenity areas to be adequately sunlit throughout the year at least half of a garden or amenity area should receive at least 2 hours of sunlight on 21 March. In terms of the communal courtyards within Blocks 1, 4, 5 and 6 only the courtyards within Blocks 4 and 5 achieve the minimum requirement of at least 50% of the space receiving at least 2 hours sunlight on the 21 March."

>"The courtyards of Block 1 and 6 will achieve 2 hours of sunlight on the 21 March across 39.6% and 26.7% of their respective areas and as such fall below the 50% target. Whilst this does not mean the amenity space is of poor value it does mean that the greater proportion of the courtyards will be in the shade and as such careful consideration will need to be given to the type and form of landscaping that will be provided within these communal areas to allow them to be used effectively throughout the year. 160. Blocks 2 and 3 both contain a significant amount of terraced housing with private rear gardens. These gardens are located between the rear facades of the blocks of terraced dwellings which face north and south away from each other. Of these 49 private amenity spaces only three meet the March target with the rest of the gardens in the shade as a result of shadows cast by the taller elements of Blocks 4 and 5. During the summertime, when amenity spaces will be more intensively used, all but two will be well lit in terms of having in excess of 50% of the area receiving at least two hours of sunlight."

>"Of the amenity spaces that fail to meet the March target, there are 26 spaces that do not receive any sunlight on the 21 March and will be completely in the shade. As is the case with the courtyards of Block 1 and 6, this does not mean that the amenity space is unusable for this part of the year subject to careful landscaping considerations. Achieving compliant sunlight levels within the private and communal amenity spaces on the FDS has been a challenge largely due to the need to provide a significant uplift in housing units and density whilst meeting the townscape objectives of the AAAP which sought taller development along the park edge, perimeter blocks and then lower density housing towards the north of the site to manage the transition between high and low density areas. Having the taller buildings to the south of the site results in long shadows being cast which has resulted in many amenity spaces being in the shade."

@. Inspector Coffey's report summarises the sunlight/daylight issues well:

>"given that it is intended that these dwellings will replace existing housing which benefits from good standards of daylight internally and well lit sunny amenity areas, the scheme for the FDS would not improve the environmental well-being of the Order Land." (paragraph 370)

Note to Chris: obviously we are going to have to revise this section once the revised planning application is submitted and we have been able to review how the sunlight/daylight issues have been address, or not as the case may be.

## Open space requirements
@. Policy PL5 (Open Space) of the AAAP says:

>"New development must provide a high quality network of public open spaces of different sizes and functions which link well together and contain good pedestrian and cycling routes."

@. Policy 4.5.1 of the AAAP envisages no net loss of open space, but the approved masterplan application (ref:14/AP/3844) acknowledges that there will be a net loss of 1.8 hectares of open space:

![Extract from the planning committee report for the masterplan application.](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/aylesburygreenspace.png)

@. Furthermore, the majority of the replacement open space will be privately managed. Only a small amount will be public open space adopted by the Council and most of this comprises just pavement on the perimeter of the new development.

![Extract from FDS planning application docs 15/AP/4584](http://35percent.org/img/aylesburyopenspaces.png)

## Transport/public realm requirements
@. The AAAP says that the Scheme should provide an improved and modern cycle enviroment (quotes).

@. As a statutory consultee, TFL objected to NHHT's planning application, in its [formal response to the application](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!4pokZj%2fGk2vz59bcWED5rw%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) it said that _"The Masterplan is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to provide an exemplar walking and cycling environment .. However, TfL is concerned that the application material fails to demonstrate this."_

>"The proposals for Thurlow Street and Albany Street in particular, key streets in the Masterplan, are considered poor. These two roads are also earmarked in the TA for freight, servicing and construction traffic, which underlines the need for better provision for cyclists. East-west links, and permeability to the surrounding areas, particularly beyond Old Kent Road and Walworth Road, are not adequately considered, nor are the linkages to the Council’s proposed ‘Southwark Spine’ cycle route along Portland Street."

>"The Masterplan should encourage active travel, prioritising walking and cycling over motorised modes. This can only be achieved through the creation of safe and appealing streets, easy access to public transport, a coherent cycle network, and attractive cycling facilities. TfL is not currently satisfied that this approach is being taken."

>"The application material fails to propose a coherent network of safe, accessible and welcoming cycle routes. All of the pedestrian routes should be accessible to cycling unless there is a clear and justified reason they should not be. The total lack of segregation proposed in the Masterplan does not reflect current policy and guidance."

>"The TA predicts a significant uplift in bus passenger demand (over 280 additional trips in the AM peak). Buses passing the site are already crowded, and TfL is seeking an extension of a route from Elephant and Castle to support the FDS, funded through the s106 agreement for that site. The additional demand from the Masterplan will require further capacity enhancements. Therefore £3.75m (indexed) is sought, to be secured in the s106 agreement for the Masterplan, to fund for these enhancements for the first five years of operation, for example increasing the frequency of operation on route 42."

@. It is unerstood that NHHT only agreed to pay £1.5??m... check s106 agreement

>"TfL recommends that across the Masterplan area, at least two medium sized (30) point docking stations should be provided, one of which should be located in the FDS. At an absolute minimum 60 docking points are required across the Masterplan area. This will reduce stress arising from the development on the already heavily used nearby existing Cycle Hire docking stations. Space should be reserved in the masterplan for a Cycle Hire docking station together with one in the FDS, and should be secured in any subsequent planning permission. Further details of the location and space requirements for this can be provided by TfL. £200,000 (index linked) should be secured in the Masterplan s106 agreement, to cover the cost of delivery and maintenance of this docking station."

@. It is understood that NHHT resisted TFL's requirement for a cycle docking station on the FDS.

## Private amenity space requirements
@. Policy PL7 of the AAAP says:

>"All development must contain high quality private open space in the form of communal gardens, private gardens and useable balconies. The design of communal gardens should comply with the guidance in Appendix 6."

@. The appendix 6 refererred to in appendix 6 says:

>"All dwellings must have direct access to private open spaces, whether in the form of a garden, roof garden, courtyard or balcony. 1/2 bedroom dwellings must have a minimum of 6 sqm of private amenity space. Larger dwellings should aim to meet the minimum standards set out in the Residential Design Standards SPD."

@. The Residential Design Standards SPD requires 3 bed flats to have a minimum of 10sqm and _"For new housing, a minimum of 50sqm of private garden spaces is required and this should be at least 10m in length. The private gardens should extend across the entire width of the dwellings."_

@. Paragraphs 143 and 144 of the planning committee report re-affirm these requirements:

>"The AAAP Appendix 6 requires at least 6sqm private amenity space for one and two bedroom flats with the remaining units being required to meet the minimum private amenity space standards set out in the SPD Residential Design Standards. The SPD requires flats with three or more bedrooms have a minimum requirement of 10sqm. With regards to houses, the SPD seeks private gardens that are at least the width of the house, extend at least 10 metres in depth and provide 50sqm of garden space. This requirement also applies to ground floor maisonettes."

@. Paragraph 147 of the planning committee report confirm that only one terraced dwelling in block 2 meets with the minimum 10 metre depth and eight fail to meet the 50sqm minimum garden space requirement. Paragraph 148 confirms that none of the dwellings in block 3 meet with the 10 metre depth and only five meet with the 50sqm garden space requirement.

@. The Objectors note that the planning committee report has incorrectly sought to offset the shortfall against the communal amenity space provided. The Residential Design SPD says that this is permissible, but only in relation to new flat developments (policy 3.2) not new detached, semi-detached or terraced houses (policy 3.1). 

## Dual aspect
@. Policy A6.7.8 of the AAAP says _"At least 75% of apartments in each development should have dual aspect."_

@. Paragraph 128 of the planning committee report confirms that only _"70% of apartments and maisonettes/duplex units"_ on the FDS site will be dual aspect

## Privacy and overlooking
@. Appendix 6 of the AAAP expects proposals to ensure that the privacy of occupants is protected without compromising the ability to create a compact urban neighbourhood. It does not set out specific requirements for separation distances, but references the Residential Design Standards SPD. 

@. The SPD specifies a minimum rear-rear separation distance of 21m but paragraph 140 of the planning committee report acknowledges that _"there is one point at which the distance between habitable windows for the general needs flats reduces to 14 metres, but generally the distance is between 17m and 20m."_

## Play space requirements
@. Policy PL6 of the AAAP says _"All development proposals must provide 10sqm of children’s play space / youth space per child bed space. Doorstep playable space should be provided within each of the housing blocks, whilst larger local playable spaces should be provided within selected housing blocks and within the green fingers and existing local parks, in accordance with Figure 12. New youth space should be provided within the larger areas of public open space."_


@. Here's a link to the environmental statement: http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!pMsWP8tiTauKMmiQZaV9cQ%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d

## Mixed use/retail requirements
@. In order to create a mix of uses across the action plan area, AAAP policy __'COM6'__ requires the Scheme to _"Provide 1,750 square metres of new local retail facilities (convenience retail, cafes and restaurants) within the action area core"._

@. Appendix 5 of the AAAP specifies that the phase 1 of the Scheme should provide a total of 1,050sqm of retail floorspace, of which the FDS should deliver 250sqm. However, only 400sqm was provided on phase 1a and the FDS planning consent does not include provision for any retail floorspace whatsoever (See paragraph 80 of the planning committee report).

@. This will fail to achieve the mix of uses envisaged by the AAAP.

## Community Space requirements

@. The DPA says that NHHT is to provide a community facility on the order land comprising at least 250sqm. But the planning committee report says that this could be provided as a gym (use class D2). 

![](http://35percent.org/img/fdscommunityfacility.png)

@. The [planning committee report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!Vbu5QpckfYCnJrulzlWyuQ%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) for the outline application shows how far short the Scheme will fall of AAAP requirements if the minimum specification is adhered to:

![](http://35percent.org/img/outlinecommunityspace.png)

## Monitoring of compliance
@. The Objectors submit that the Acquiring Authority's lack of robust section 106 monitoring procedures will result is likely to result in yet further non-compliance with the obligations of the planning consent and thus further non-compliance with the AAAP.

@. The section 106 agreement for the FDS negotiated a sum of just £1,567 for the ongoing monitoring of compliance with planning obligations. 

![](http://35percent.org/img/monitoringcontribution.png)

@. At the previous public inquiry the Objectors raised the issue of NHHT's Bermondsey Spa regeneration where it had delivered Affordable Rent instead of the Social Rent required by the planning consent. The Acquiring Authority bla bla lied and then took no action against NHHT.

@. The 35% Campaign referred the Bermondsey Spa complaint and 46 other breaches they had identified in a complaint to the Local Government Ombudsman. After an investigation by the Ombudsman the Acquiring Authority was forced to acknowledge that it didn't have any monitoring procedures whatsoever. 

@. The Ombudsman directed the AA to conduct a borough-wide audit of compliance and introduce s106 monitoring procedures going forward. The AA has sinced allocated just £60,000 to this audit and pay for software and staffing for ongoing compliance. This is insufficient means to ensure that the.. 

## Infrastructure funding requirements
 @. Page 75 of the AAAP describes infrastructure funding. It says the developer will pay a tariff which will fund community facilities like the health centre and other community facilities. However, we now know that the Council is paying for the £35m cost of them mainly from its own funds.

@. The AAAP said that this infrastructure was to be funded by means of a tariff and that the details of the tariff will be published in a subsequent SPD - The Section 106 & CIL SPD (2015). This requires each development to pay a levy towards local infrastructure. Paragraph 5.8 of the SPD specifically states _"CIL will replace the section 106 tariffs set out in the Aylesbury Area Action Plan"_ and sets out a charging schedule showing a requirement of £50 per square metre of residential floorspace

@. The planning committee report for the FDS says: _The total existing floorspace on the FDS equates to approximately 54,747sqm. The total proposed floorspace is 81,432sqm. Provided that the existing buildings on the FDS remain in use for at least 6 months within the 36 months prior to implementation, the existing floorspace can be deducted from that proposed to give a figure of 26,685sqm .. This would incur a charge of £1,320,500."_

@. The report is not clear as to whether this will be paid and given the absence of a CIL liability notice in the planning application documents, the Objectors request further details of whether the FDS and Outline Schemes are liable for CIL and whether a CIL contribution has been agreed.

@. The [S106 agreement] says this:

![](http://35percent.org/img/s106cil.png)

@. [This press release](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/news/2017/feb/a-35m-investment-into-new-community-facilities-at-heart-of-one-of-london-s-biggest-regeneration-projects-has-been-approved) confirms that the Acquiring Authority is footing £23m of the £35m required from its capital budget, the remainder being sourced from s106 contributions from other developments in the borough plus a contribution from NHHT.

@. The Development Partnership Agreement says that NHHT's contribution to the facilities is £9m - however it also contains a clause saying that NHHT can deduct from this £9m, all of its site assembly costs for the FDS (currently amounting to £14.5m according to paragraph 8.4 of the AA's SoC). 

@. A7 .1.40 gives a breakdown of the estimated costs of infrastructure that the tariff will fund. It says how much is required per unit but I can't read it on my pdf as it looks corrupted. I Need to see a hard copy.
 
--
@. Southwark is filling the gap - its SoC confirms it has allocated £100m to the Scheme over next 3/5 years? and £46m has already been spent. Its 2005 Committee decision was based on the assumption that the Scheme would be cost neutral.

@. Council has already seen xx budget cuts - with £39m cut from adult and social care in this year alone. A further 77% of its budget is due to be cut by 2020. There is a clear austerity case for refurb rather than demolition.

@. [This article](https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/installing-sprinklers-southwarks-council-housing-cost-100m/) confirms the Council is considering spending £100m on sprinklers for its tower blocks and admits that if no govt funding is found then _"other things will have to be put on hold"_.


## The Scheme fails to conform with the development plan's Equalities Impact mitigation measures (and consequently PSED)
@. The AAAP said there will be a 'range of options to enable leaseholders to stay in area, buy into new scheme etc..'

@. This was discussed in more detail in the Equalities Assessment conducted in conjunction with the AAAP.
(the [2009 EqIA which accommpanied the AAAP](http://35percent.org/img/EqualitiesImpactAssessment.pdf)), relied upon the mitigation measures in place at the time for leaseholders- i.e. the rehousing options enshrined in the Council's [2006 rehousing policy](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/1850/executive_report) which included the like-for-like 'propery swap' for leaseholders. The 2006 policy and the Council's [Handbook for leaseholders](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/331856/response/818864/attach/3/64145%20RedR%20Homeowner.pdf) clearly state the 'property swap' as one of the available rehousing options:

![Extract from the [Leaseholders Handbook](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/331856/response/818864/attach/3/64145%20RedR%20Homeowner.pdf)](http://35percent.org/img/aylesburyleaseholdershandbookoptions.png)

@. The handbook gives a detailed description of the property swap policy available to leaseholders:

![Extract from the [Leaseholders Handbook](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/331856/response/818864/attach/3/64145%20RedR%20Homeowner.pdf)](http://35percent.org/img/aylesburyhandbookswap.png)

@. The EqIA specifically references the 2006 rehousing policy for leaseholders which it says offers leaseholders the _'widest possible choice of rehousing opportunities'_:

![Extract from the AAAP's EqIA](http://35percent.org/img/spiritofcooperation.png)  

![Exract from the AAAP's EqIA](http://35percent.org/img/widestpossiblechoice.png)  

@. Given that the 'property swap' option was subsequently withdrawn in 2010, it can be argued that the scheme doesn't comply with the PSED because one of the mitigation measures set out in the EqIA which underlies the AAAP has been withdrawn. Indeed it was the only mitigation measure that would have enabled leaseholders to remain 100% homeowners in the borough - i.e. not impoverished by the shared ownership options. 

@. Inspector Coffey said that leaseholders are left with two bleak options: moving out of the area or remaining but being impoverished. Like-for-like swap was the only option that would have enabled leaseholders to remain in the area without being impoverished. *We will need to show that the shared equity deal impoverishes leaseholders despite change in the £16k policy. (Investigate service charges etc)*

## The scheme underlying the Order is not viable and therefore not deliverable.
There are three main factors contributing to the non-viability of the scheme:

1. The Scheme was not viable in the first place
2. £180m of allocated government funding has been withdrawn since the AAAP was adopted
3. The government has cut the amount housing associations can charge for (social) rents and introduced a cap in Local Housing Allowance
https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2012/aug/09/housing-benefit-caps-end-tenancies-in-london

@. Documents submitted to the examination in public of the AAAP, show that the Aylesbury scheme as envisaged is still not viable and that the viability gap is being bridged by shortchanging leaseholders. In Jan 2009, the [draft Aylesbury Area Action Plan](http://35percent.org/img/DraftAAAP.pdf) showed that there was a funding shortfall of £299m. 

![Page 92 of the [appendices](http://35percent.org/img/DraftAAAP_appendices.pdf) to the [draft AAAP](http://35percent.org/img/DraftAAAP.pdf)](http://35percent.org/img/DraftAAAP_appendices.png)

@. The ability to be able to deliver an Area Action Plan is one of the government’s key tests on the “soundness” of the plan and a requirement that a plan meets these tests of soundness.

@. The inspector at the examination in public of Southwark's AAAP, [flagged up](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/352116/response/873296/attach/3/160926%20EIR%20FOI%20685920.pdf) the significant funding gap to the Council and her [final report](http://35percent.org/img/AAAP_inspectors_report.pdf) on the AAAP shows that the Council's solution was to arbitrarily slash the cost estimates, without providing any evidence base or justification for doing so. The £130m originally estimated for leasehold acquisitions of the circa 500 leasehold properties on the estate was slashed by half. There is no explanation as to why the Council slashed its estimate of the market value of leaseholders' homes by 50% overnight. 

![[Table of Recommended Changes to AAAP (2009)](http://35percent.org/img/Table_of_Recommended_Changes.pdf) showing cost estimates slashed](http://35percent.org/img/Recommended_Changes.png)

@. Altogether, the cost estimates were reduced by around a half, reducing the funding gap from £299m down to £169m and this is the figure given in the [final adopted version of the AAAP](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/downloads/download/4444/area_action_plans). 

![Extract from final adopted version of [Aylesbury Area Action Plan 2010](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/downloads/download/4444/area_action_plans) showing the funding gap](http://35percent.org/img/aaapfundinggap.png)

@. The Acquiring Authority was expecting to cover the funding shortfall with government PFI funding and this is how the Area Action Plan was deemed sound at its Examination in Public. However, just under a year after the Area Action Plan was adopted, the government [withdrew](http://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/dec/26/cut-regeneration-tony-blair-housing) all PFI funding for the scheme. 

@. The September 2011 board meeting minutes of the Aylesbury New Deal for Communities (by now renamed Creation Trust), confirmed that _“at the time of writing the AAAP each [affordable housing] unit was supported with £125k of funding, this has now been reduced to £25,000”_ [OCD24, para 2.4]

@. How much funding is there now per unit? What does Mayor's current funding programme say?

@. The previous inquiry was (mis)led to believe that NHHT would receive £27m from the Mayor's 2014-16? AHP - what has happened to this?


@. The Sustainability Assessment for the AAAP said:

>"Early financial modelling indicated that about 5000 homes would need to be provided on the footprint of the estate to make any redevelopment financially viable. All the options therefore were predicated around this figure."

>"Following consultation on these options, the council decided to revise options relating to housing, in order to meet concerns that the scheme needed to be more family friendly. These revisions related to housing tenure, density, type of homes, bedroom split, tall buildings and provision of private amenity space. The overall numbers of units to be provided were reduced from 5,000 new dwellings to 4,200 new dwellings."

@. In June 2016 NHHT was [downgraded](http://35percent.org/img/nhhtmoodys.pdf) by Moodys. Moodys' downgrade notice mentioned NHHT's significant development pipeline and its three major schemes; the Aylesbury estate, Canada Water and a scheme in Hounslow. 

@. The Moodys report states that just 7% of the homes in NHHT's pipeline are social rent. So the replacement 'social' homes on the FDS must have been included in these figures as affordable rent. To conclude: Moody's capex to revenue ratio must have been based on the provision of affordable rent not social rent. Had it been based on social rent then the capex to revenue ratio would have been much higher. So either Moodys have been given incorrect info on the tenure mix of NHHT's pipeline or the replacement 'social' homes on the Aylesbury will be affordable rent..

![Extract from Moodys downgrading [announcement](http://35percent.org/img/nhhtmoodys.pdf)](http://35percent.org/img/nhhtmoodys.png)  

@. In paragraph xxx of its Statement of Case, the Acquiring Authority has inferred that the Scheme has received funding from the GLA. However, its £26m? funding allocation under the GLA's 2014-16? Affordable Homes Programme is now compromised by the fact that phasing for the FDS has been delayed and will not be completed until 2024 [(See here)](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s68300/Appendix%202%20Draft%20development%20agreement.pdf) (funding requirement is that the scheme is completed before March 2019?). 

@. In paragraph xxx of its Statement of Case, the Acquiring Authority has asserted that £76m of its own funds have been set aside for the scheme over the next five years. However, it does not explain that this covers only site assembly - i.e. leaseholder compensation, decant and rehousing costs, demolition etc. Given that there is no funding for construction of the Scheme, then it cannot be claimed to be viable at the consented tenure mix. 
 
## The Acquiring Authority has failed to comply with the requirements of the ODPM 06/04 Circular regarding provision of viability information 
@. Paragraph 16 (iii) of Appendix A of the 06/2004 Circular says(emphasis added):

>"Any decision about whether to confirm an order made under section 226(1)(a) of the 1990 Act will be made on its own merits, but the factors which the Secretary of State can be expected to consider include .. (iii) the potential financial viability of the scheme for which the land is being acquired. A general indication of funding intentions, and of any commitments from third parties, will usually suffice to reassure the Secretary of State that there is a reasonable prospect that the scheme will proceed. __The greater the uncertainty about the financial viability of the scheme, however, the more compelling the other grounds for undertaking the compulsory purchase will need to be__. The timing of any available funding may also be important. For example, a strict time-limit on the availability of the necessary funding may be an argument put forward by the acquiring authority to justify proceeding with the order before finalising the details of the replacement scheme and/or the statutory planning position."

@. The Objectors submit that there is indeed _"great uncertainty about the financial viability of the scheme"_ and that therefore the Acquiring Authority is required to make a _"more compelling"_ case for _"the other grounds for undertaking the compulsory purchase"_. 

@. Paragraph 19 of the ODPM 06/04 Circular states that “If an Acquiring Authority cannot show that all the necessary resources are likely to be available to achieve that end within a reasonable time-scale, it will be difficult to show conclusively that the compulsory acquisition of the land included in the order is justified in the public interest.”

@. Paragraph 20 of the ODPM 06/04 Circular says:

>"In preparing its justification, __the acquiring authority should provide as much information as possible__ about the resource implications of both acquiring the land and implementing the scheme for which the land is required. It may be that the scheme is not intended to be independently financially viable, or that the details cannot be finalised until there is certainty about the assembly of the necessary land. In such instances, __the acquiring authority should provide an indication of how any potential shortfalls are intended to be met. This should include the degree to which other bodies (including the private sector) have agreed to make financial contributions or to underwrite the scheme, and on what basis such contributions or underwriting is to be made.__"

@. Contrary to the requirements of paragraphs 20 of ODPM Circular 06/2004, insufficient information is given in the Statement of Reasons for making the CPO detailing the cost of the scheme or how it will be funded. All the AA's SoC says about funding is that xxx...

@. The Acquiring Authority has rejected repeated requests by the Objectors to supply information concerning funding and the viability of the scheme. All financial information has been redacted from the Development Partnership Agreement included in the core bundle. The Objectors understand that the Inspector does have the power to require the production of any documents by summons “which relate to any matter in question at the inquiry”.[^1]

@. The Objectors therefore request that an unredacted copy of the DPA, business plan, viability assessment and any funding agreements are supplied to the inquiry, in order to satisfy the requiremments of paragraph 20 of the ODPM and for the inquiry to be able to establish that the Scheme is deliverable in accordance with the requirements of the development plan.

## The non-viability of the Scheme may result in it not be delivered in a reasonable time period 

@. Show how [Wood Dene estate](http://35percent.org/wood-dene-estate-regeneration/) was demolished in 2007 and how NHHT has [left the site empty](https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/notting-hill-admits-wood-dene-estate-peckham-wont-rebuilt-2019-thirteen-years-demolition/) for 10 years without building any new homes. This will be the future of phase 1b/1c.  

![](http://35percent.org/img/nhhtwooddeneadmission.png)  

@. The DPA says that the FDS will be completed by 2021, but NHHT have now put this back to 2024. See [here](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s68300/Appendix%202%20Draft%20development%20agreement.pdf).

@. Schedule 2 0n page 82 of the DPA says that NHHT is given to 2044 to complete the development, but the AAAP envisaged that the Scheme would be completed by 2027. 

@. The DPA requires NHHT to complete the FDS before a given date (XX?) regardless of viability. Has this now been breached given that NHHT has swapped FDS with plot 18?

@. There is nothing compelling NHHT to complete any of the development phases should it declare them unviable.


## The non-viability of the Scheme may result in a failure to conform with the affordable housing requirements of the development plan
@. Para 4.8.4 on page 136 of the DPA says that if (confidential) viability assessments show that the scheme has become unviable then changes to the businees plan and DPA will be sought.

@. Para 4.8.6 says that both parties will be free to terminate the DPA if phases are deemed unviable.

@. The Moodys downgrade report confirmed that on average NHHT is delivering 7% social rented housing across schemes in its current pipeline and this is despite NHHT having received record levels of funding (£92m - GLA?). 

@. The Objectors submit that in the absence of dedicated government or GLA funding to replace the PFI funding anticipated at the time the AAAP was drafted, the minimum 37.5% social rented housing across the Aylesbury scheme us undeliverable.

@. The Objectors submit that if the Order as it stands is confirmed, then the shortfall will be made up both by continuing to shortchange leaseholders and passing off affordable rented tenure as social rent.

@. This has indeed been the fate of several other schemes completed by NHHT. It was shown at the previous inquiry how NHHT had delivered affordable rented homes at up to 62% market rent at its Bermondsey Spa regeneration, when social rent was agreed in the DPA, planning committee report and section 106 agreement.

@. The same is true of NHHT's regeneration of the xxx estate in neighbouring Lambeth. This was ......

@. Affordable rent was introduced in 2011 to allow housing associations to charge higher rents (up to 80% market rent) to its tenants. The mayor has recently introduced several other social housing tenures, including 'London Living Rent' and 'London Affordable Rent'.  

@. The AAAP specifically requires that a minimum 37.5% of the new homes must be social rent. At the time the AAAP was drafted social rent was the only rented social housing tenure. The AAAP predates affordable rent and the other new tenures that have been created. The AAAP specifically states its aim as to help 'most vulnerable' to remain in area - to rehouse tenants on the estate footprint etc. and this is why it specified such a high proportion of social rented homes that would guarantee remained affordable for existing tenants.

@. Given the deregulation of the housing association sector which has ensued after the AAAP was adopted, it is no surprise that existing Aylesbury tenants are not taking up the replacement 'social housing' on the completed phases. Of the xxx tenants decanted from the FDS, only xx have been rehoused on the footprint and of the xxx decanted from the next phase  (phase 2) only 34 have been rehoused on the footprint. 

@. The fear over rising housing association rents is exacerbated not just by the sudden deregulation of the sector but also fierce lobbying by housing association to be able to increase rents as they see fit. 

@. NHHT is one of the most active lobbyists among housing associations. In 2007, its CEO Kate Davies - then a member of the thinktank CSJ along with Iain Duncan Smith, co-authored a paper in which she wrote:

>"State provided solutionss...

>"Housing associations should be free to set their own rent..

@. In 2011, when the government introduced its controversial affordable rent tenure, allowing social rents to be increased to up to 80% market rent, NHHT wrote in its official response to the govt consultation:

>"bla bla we really support this"

@. Submit copy of [Southwark's evidence](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/CPO_ExplanatoryNote12May2015.pdf) from previous Inquiry where they claim to have robust S106 monitoring procedures.

![Extract from Southwark's [evidence to first Inquiry](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/CPO_ExplanatoryNote12May2015.pdf)](http://35percent.org/img/CPO_ExplanatoryNote.png)

@. Submit copy of [Ombudsman decision](http://35percent.org/2016-12-12-ombudsman-slams-southwark-for-no-s106-monitoring/) and Sunday Times [article](http://35percent.org/img/ST23April2017.pdf) showing Southwark's failure to monitor S106 AH tenure delivery, as a result of it not having any monitoring procedures. Show how it therefore misled the previous Inquiry with its evidence claiming to have robust monitoring procedures.

@. Highlight NHHT's other developments where social rent intended but affordable rent delivered - i.e. the one in Lambeth delivered on the [Claremont East estate](http://35percent.org/2017-01-16-draft-more-on-notting-hill/#claremont-east-estate-lambeth).

@. Show how the breach at Bermondsey Spa hasn't been resolved, i.e. the Council hasn't taken effective action to recover the SR homes - i.e. there still remains a net loss across the Bermondsey Spa and Manor Place Depot sites.  

@. Re-run all of our previous criticisms of Kate Davies and her predeliction for affordable rent and privatisation. Include also Steve Hilditch's recent [article](https://redbrickblog.wordpress.com/2017/01/07/one-article-does-not-wipe-the-slate-clean/) criticising Davies and Notting Hill (Hilditch is a former NHHT board member).

## Bashing NHHT 
@. Submit the  on NHHT's rent hikes and evictions at its St. James estate in Bermondsey. Include MP Neil Coyle's criticisms and Cllr Pollak's quote saying NHHT is acting like a 'predatory landlord'. 

![[Southwark News article, 6/10/16](https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/housing-association-slammed-nightmare-scenario-eviction-threat-bermondseys-st-james-estate/)](http://35percent.org/img/nhhtevictions.png)  

@. Highlight NHHT's profit margin in the DPA.

@. Show how Wood Dene estate and Decathlon sites appear to have stalled. Point out affordable scandal at the Decathlon site (blog post to be drafted still) and the low level of social rented housing at the Wood Dene and Silwood redevelopments, despite them receiving funding. Make the point that NHHT successfully argued (using viability assessments) that it wasn't viable to provide more than the pitiful 15% (avg) social rented housing across both sites. So how can it be possible that the FDS site can viably provide over 40% social rented?

@. Include evidence on the Silwood estate and the 3 missing social rented housing units that NHHT should have delivered according to the planning consent and S106 agreement.

@. Show HCA/GLA stats showing how many thousands of homes NHHT has converted to affordable rent. 

## DPA provisions breached
@. NHHT has breached various provisions in the DPA including its obligation to purchase 5 street properties that it was to offer on shared equity terms to leaseholders in phase 1b/1c. The Council claims in its response to our Cabinet question that NHHT has indeed provided 2 such properties to leaseholders on the FDS. We should seek more details of this and ask why these were not offered to Beverley and Agnes.

@. The following changes to the funding programme show how NHHT is rolling back on its funding commitments to the scheme. In September 2016, Southwark [agreed](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s63817/Report.Aylesbury%20Regeneration%20Delivery.pdf) a number of changes to the development agreement with NHHT. Southwark agreed to forward fund £21m of the ongoing costs of progressing the scheme, that NHHT was originally required to fund under the terms of the Development Partnership Agreement. These comprised:

![](/img/dpafunding.png)

> * £16.8m demolition costs for the First Development Site
> * £0.8m for the demolition of Plot 18
> * £2m to underwrite the cost of Plot 18’s planning application
> * £2m to underwrite the design fees for phase 2

@. These costs are in addition to the Council’s other costs that it has already agreed to allocate to the scheme. In total the Council is now forecast to spend £52.5m over the next three years on the Aylesbury redevelopment scheme.

@. Notting Hill Housing’s commitment to the scheme is also plainly a concern. The [Cabinet report](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s63817/Report.Aylesbury%20Regeneration%20Delivery.pdf) goes on to say that _‘if the scheme has not proceeded in accordance with the DPA (Development Partnership Agreement)’_ then _‘at that point all design work will pass to the council enabling the council to market the site’_(para. 13) - in plain language: if Notting Hill drops out then Southwark takes over and looks for another developer. 

@. NHHT is also now [reducing](http://www.aylesburynow.london/news/posts/extra-affordable-homes-for-aylesbury-regeneration) the number of affordable units in plot 18, its first phase of development to be completed on the estate. It is moving these to be delivered instead on the FDS. Note that the [9 May Cabinet report](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s68298/Report%20Aylesbury%20Regeneration%20Programme%20Delivery.pdf) announced a change of phasing: the FDS has been swapped with plot 18 - i.e. the FDS will instead be the second phase of development completed by NHHT after plot 18. Fresh planning applications for both sites are expected shortly.
 
@ . The Objectors submit that the number of social housing units on plot 18 has been reduced as a result of viability issues. The Objectors submit that this will be the fate of the FDS.
----
@. The DPA business plan says that the developer will provide a specific number of offsite units from its existing stock to assist with tenant rehousing. It also agreed to convert some of its stock from affordable rent to social rent and to purchase several street properties and repair them for aylesbury residents to move in to.

![](http://35percent.org/img/schedulenhhtoffsiteprovision.png)

@. How many of these have actually been provided?

@. See table below the above one..

@. Cabinet said 2/3? P&R properties have been provided, why not 5? and why weren't Beverley etc offered this option?


## Refurb/Alternative to scheme underlying the CPO 

@. Work out how much AA receives in rental income from tenants on the estate. Say it should use this on refurb/maintenance instead of £100k salaries for PR managers (Tony Mainwairing). 

@. Paragraph 1.2.4 of the AAAP says that the estate needs to be redeveloped because "it would cost too much to bring the homes up to decent homes standard".

@. The Sep 2005 Cabinet report which informed this decision said that the cost of bringing homes up to DHS would be £93m, which included £13m for repairing/replacing the heating system. This has already been committed and £xxm has been spent on bringing xx number of homes up to DHS already. 

@. This is confirmed in Council briefing papers and also Para 360 of the OR for the planning application for the FDS, which says: "The heating system has become more reliable recently due to upgrades to pipework and other pieces of equipment."

@. Given that the AAAP was drafted on the basis of the 2005 data, i.e. before significant improvement works were undertaken and that given the extent of these works undertaken in the meantime, the estate is now less needy of redevlopment than it was at the time of the AAAP.

@. Southwark Council's own report in 2015, carried out by by the council's Principal Design and Technical officer Catherine Bates, said, "The condition of the buildings on the estate does not, itself, present a case for demolition and redevelopment."

@. Inspector should discount the current condition of buildings on the Order Land: Any actual or perceived failure in the local housing market that may exist is partly attributable to, or in the alternative has been exacerbated by, the activities of the Acquiring Authority and its partners. Therefore no reliance can be placed upon the Acquiring Authority’s evidence in this respect. Properties that have already been purchased voluntarily by the Acquiring Authority, or by its development partners, have not been occupied subsequent to their acquisition. Instead, they have been secured but left in a manner which fosters an impression of dereliction and decay, with consequent blighting effects, under which ambitions for compulsory purchase of additional land might be considered to be more readily achievable. The Acquiring Authority has therefore attempted to present a fait accompli. Accordingly the Inspector cannot place any reliance on circumstances created by the Acquiring Authority. Further, these properties have not been demolished, thus implying a lack of confidence in the scheme underlying the CPO on the part of the Acquiring Authority or its development partners. 

@. Quote from the Housing Commission HINES estates data showing only half of estate's homes fail to meet DHS.


![](http://35percent.org/img/wendcomp.jpg)  

@. [This report](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s56449/Report%20Major%20works%20status%20report%20incorporating%20Warm%20Dry%20and%20Safe.pdf) describes different funding for DHS works, including the 'GLA Backlog fund' and the [accompanying appendices](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s56450/Appendices%201%20-%204%20Major%20works%20status%20report%20incorporating%20Warm%20Dry%20and%20Safe.pdf) show that the Four Squares estate (a High Investment Needs estate) was brought up to DHS for just £12m. Work out how much this is per unit and also show similar comparables.

@. On the question of sources of funding a refurb scheme, one could also include the Section 106 off-site pooled funding and that set aside for new Council homes. Refurbishment would also help the Council save on the [£10m per year it is having to spend on temporary accommodation](https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/council-spend-temporary-housing-now-five-times-20112012/):

![](http://35percent.org/img/spendbandb.png)  

@. [This Cabinet item](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieIssueDetails.aspx?IId=11030&Opt=3) from 2011 gives details of 'High Investment Needs estates' and gives cost estimates of DHS works. 

@. Appendix 6 of the Cabinet item shows the Aylesbury as not being the most costly of the estates. We could find out the actual costs of other estates on the list and do a comparison. Here's the [link to appendix 6](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s19628/Appendix%206%20List%20of%2015%20High%20Investment%20Needs%20Estates.pdf)

@. Southwark has in any case already [committed £12.5m to Major Works](http://35percent.org/img/Aylesbury-Phase-2-newsletter-February-2017-JH.pdf) bringing homes on phase 3/4 of the estate up to Decent Homes Standard.

@. An alternative scheme (referred to as ‘Plan B’ in the Statement of Reasons for making the CPO) has been promoted by a group of local stakeholders, using the acronym xxx. The scheme proposed by xxx is clearly superior to that of the Acquiring Authority. It would require less funding, would be less intrusive and would meet the Acquiring Authority’s objective of achieving an improved.

@. AA is pending £380k per unit on new Council house building programme (not including land acquisition costs) - it has £xxm set aside for this and we suggest that this should be used instead 

Conclusion: 
@. The AAAP envisaged redevelopment because at the time it was assumed that "it would cost too much to bring the homes up to decent homes standards". It asserted that redevlopement would also enable an uplift in density to 4200 new homes and that these would be of better quality in terms of environment and sustainability. Given that the scheme fails to conform with these objectives and given the significant number of homes brought up to DHS in the interim ...

@. Also, given the fact that redevelopment has proven to be more costly and DHS works less costly...

@. Council has spent £46m redeveloping just 112 homes and has allocated £96m over next five years. This would be sufficient to bring xx homes on the Order Land up tp DHS.
 
--------
@. Paragraph 16(iv) of the ODPM 06/04 lists factors which the Secretary of State should consider in determining whether to confirm the order:

>"whether the purpose for which the acquiring authority is proposing to acquire the land could be achieved by any other means. This may include considering the appropriateness of any alternative proposals put forward by the owners of the land, or any other persons, for its re-use. __It may also involve examining the suitability of any alternative locations for the purpose for which the land is being acquired.__"

@. The Objectors submit that that there is an alternative location, just several hundred metres from the order land that would provide a much greater increase in density that was one of the main objectives of the development plan; the St James estate. This is approximately the same area as the order land but contains just 100 low rise, low quality, energy inefficient homes. Compulsory purchase powers would not be required because NHHT owns the freehold of all the homes, which are let privately at market rents with no social housing tenants.


 
-----

@. In 2012, the Acquiring Authority spent several million pounds on fire safety works carried out following a fire in one of its tower blocks in Peckham (Lakanal House). This was part of a borough wide policy to ensure that all buildings complied with the latest fire safety regulations. 

@. The Acquiring Authority has intimated that there are structural problems with the 5 and 6 storey blocks on the estate. However, the Alan Conisbee report on which this is based recommended removal of mains gas from these blocks. It is understood that the blocks now comply with BRE safety standards. If this is not the case then the Acquiring Authority will need to explain why it has continued to house families in these blocks for the past 12 years if they are structurally unsound. 

### Displacement
@.  How many rehoused on estate footprint as per EqIA and AAAP intention?

@. Why have only 10 of the estate's 200 leaseholders decanted to date taken up the shared equity offer? Where did the rest of the leaseholders go?

## Compensation issues
@. The Council acknowledges that the value of homes on the Aylesbury are lower than any other properties in the borough and that their shared ownership options are a recognition of this.

@. The [minutes of 10/03/2014 Overview and Scrutiny Committee](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/mgAi.aspx?ID=32015) confirm that the Council's principal surveyor said _"The council’s ownership schemes were in recognition of the fact that the price offered might not enable a leaseholder to buy another property."_

@. In his [report](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s44932/Officer%20Report%20-%20Comparison%20of%20Discretionary%20Assistance%20Given%20to%20Resident%20Leaseholders.pdf) to that Committee, the Principal Surveyor said _"Some  Councils  offer  equivalent  exchange  whereby  a  leaseholder  swops his/her property for another of the same value.  This has been considered but the properties being regenerated in this Borough tend to be at the lowest level of the value scale. There are unlikely to be similar equivalents that aren’t part of regeneration schemes so such an offer would be hollow. "_  

## Rehousing options
@. In his [evidence](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/Mark_Maginn.pdf) to the site 7 CPO inquiry, Mark Maginn explains that leaseholders are assessed for rehousing on a 'cascade' assessment basis; i.e. they are assessed to see if they can afford shared ownership before being considered for shared equity or other rehousing options. Given that shared ownership is much less attractive and more costly than shared equity, it is no surprise that only 10 of the over 200 leaseholders decanted have qualified for and taken up shared equity.

@. Request stock condition survey mentioned here: Paragraph  25  details  the  stock  condition  survey  undertaken  in  2010  which  has provided  the  most  robust  and  extensive  information  to date  on  the  state  of  the Council's  housing  stock. http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s19609/Report%20Housing%20investment%20programme%20and%20revised%20strategy.pdf

@. Request details of the following:

 * How many leaseholders rehoused as tenants? where? RSL etc?
 * How many shared ownership/equity etc.
 * Where did they go?
 * Supply copy of the Creation Trust displacement map for phase 2 - how many tenants rehoused on footprint? (34) Where did leaseholders go? Para 7.2.6 of the AAAP says _"We will accommodate approximately 50% of existing tenants through the re-provision of homes on site"_. Show how this AAAP target hasn't been met.
 * Ask whether an agreement with the MoJ has been signed for the relocation of Ellison House - if so ask for a copy of the agreement.
 * Ask whether the Council has sold any properties on the estate at auction. It is understood that the Council has bought back properties on later phases and subsequently sold them at auction rather than let them to temporary licencees.
 * Ask for details on the leaseholder who died in Arlow. How did he die? was it result of environmental conditions - i.e. discontinuity in services - heating?
 * More detail on the two leaseholders who supposedly took up NHHT's P&R street properties  (see response to Cabinet question).
 * NHHT social life survey
 * Ask to include [EPC sample](http://35percent.org/img/aylesburynewvsoldepc.pdf) in the bundle.
 * Check DPA and ask for viability review of plot 18 - i.e. the viability assessment showing it is viable. What is the positive land value to be received by the Council? This will give an indication of how little the Council will receive for subsequent phases.
 * Are there any reports required by the DPA that we can make a request for - or meetings of yearly scheduled meetings related to the DPA?
 * Request tenure delivery information: has the AA checked what tenure was delivered on completed phases? it claimed to have done so at the Oct 2015 INquiry but we now know that was a lie. Has the AA completed audit and what are the results for phase 1a and site 7?

 * Submit copy of the [2009 Leaseholders Toolkit](http://35percent.org/img/ToolkitAylesburyLeaseholders2009.pdf)
 * Submit copy of [Mr Hilmi letter telling him qualifies for shared ownership](http://35percent.org/img/hilmisharedownership.pdf)
 * Submit copy of [Letter](http://35percent.org/img/lettersenttowolvertonleaseholders.pdf) with Jane Seymour saying that re-housing offers will be withdrawn once CPO procedures start.
 * Paragraph 4.2.2.2 of Section 4 of the DPA business plan says that NHHT will set aside 142 target rent units for decanting tenants over the first 10 years of the DPA. How many of these have been allocated to date and where are they?

Conclusion:
@. In summary, the Acquiring Authority's decision to pursue compulsory purchase powers instead of negotiating with the Objectors is oppressive. The remaining leaseholders have shown themselves to be reasonable and dignified people who have continued to engage constructively. Their demands are reasonable: the Acquiring Authority should either replace their homes in a swap for another of its properties elsewhere in the borough or pay the market value for homes as determined by the independent RICS valuers that they have instructed. 

@. The Compulsory Purchase Code requires the Acquiring Authority to make a 'compelling case' in the public interest for compulsory purchase powers to be used. For the reasons given above it has failed to do so and the order should therefore not be confirmed. Non conformation will not result in the end of the Acquiring Authority's scheme; it will simply mean that the Acquiring Authority will have to rehouse remaining leaseholders using the option promised to them at the time the AAAP was agreed.



[^1]: See section 5(2) of the Acquisition of Land Act 1981, and section 250(2) of the Local Government Act 1972

The AAAP's main objective is stated as:

>"“We want the Aylesbury area to become a successful neighbourhood incorporating the highest design standards, a good mix of uses and a layout that will meet the needs of current and future generations. We want the Aylesbury area to be known for high quality socially rented and private homes that address a variety of local needs, including those of the elderly and vulnerable. We also want to be known for an outstanding environment with excellent parks and great streets which are accessible for all. We want residents to choose to stay in the area because of the quality of its schools and community facilities. Overall we want to create a place with a strong sense of community."

The AAAP's sustainability assessment says:

>"6.1.7 In the short term, demolition of the estate will run counter to objectives to minimise waste arisings. For this reason we initially set out an option to ensure that 95% of all demolition waste is either re-used or recycled, in line with the London Plan target. However, it was considered that a specific AAP policy on demolition waste would overlap existing policies and therefore this target is not specifically referred to in the publication draft. However, the Code for Sustainable Homes (certification under the code is required by AAP policy BH7) requires the provision of site waste management plans which encourage the reuse and recycling of materials. Moreover the 95% target is still set out in Southwark’s SPD on Sustainable Design and Construction which will apply to the AAP area."_

It also says:

>"7.3 LINKS TO OTHER TIERS OF PLANS AND PROGRAMMES 7.3.1 The list of policies set out in the AAP is not exhaustive and does not seek to replicate generic policies in plans which are already in existence. In implementing the redevelopment, it will be necessary to follow the requirements, in particular of the London Plan, the Southwark Plan 2007, the emerging Core Strategy and other documents in Southwark’s local development framework, including supplementary planning documents. Southwark’s SPDs on Sustainable Design and Construction, Sustainability Assessment, Sustainable Transport and Residential
Design Standards will be especially relevant."


---- DPA

FDS - Council gets three fixed payments amounting to circa £15m (VA says £17m)
NHHT pays for demolition but the total cost will be deducted from its £9m public infrastructure contribution to plot 18.



Subsequent plots depend on plot premium in para 2 of schedule 4 which says:

Word is Barratt has pulled out??


------
## Compensation issues
4.2.1.12 of the DPA Business Plan (Section 4.2) says:

>"Addressing the needs of longstanding resident leaseholders is important as they have particular difficulties in finding new homes, as in general the value of their property is lower than other similar sized properties in the borough."

The Acquiring Authority therefore acknowledges that the compensation payable is insufficient for leaseholders to remain in the area. It therefore comes down to what rehousing assistance is on offer in determining whether or not their human rights have been sufficiently safeguarded.

Cascading options - gatekeeping.

No wonder then that only 115 shared equity units have been allocated in the DPA for the 330 leaseholders.
