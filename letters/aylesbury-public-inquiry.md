## The Scheme for the Order Land is no longer in accordance with the statutory development plan
@. The compulsory purchase code requires that the Scheme underlying the Order to conform with the requirements of the statutory development plan. The statutory development plan context for the Scheme underlying this Order (“the Scheme”) is the [Aylesbury Area Action Plan 2010](http://www.2.southwark.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/13132/aylesbury_area_action_plan_2010_inc_appendices) (“AAAP”) (CD 2).

### The Scheme fails to comply with the development plan's sustainable energy requirements
Policy BH6([I] - ENERGY SUPPLY) of the AAAP requires new developments in the core action area to be serviced by one single CHP energy plant:

>"The energy supply for the action area core will be generated by combined heat and power (CHP). The CHP plant should be part of an energy centre located immediately south of the junction of Thurlow Street and Inville Road and appropriately sized to accommodate plant required to deliver services to the development. The redevelopment of the action area core will result in zero carbon growth. All developments within the action area core must connect to the CHP system. Developments completed prior to the implementation of CHP should be designed
so that they can switch to the CHP once it is available." 

The Scheme falls short of these requirements in that it will be serviced by its own permananent CHP plant, which will have the 'potential' to be connected to the proposed energy centre on Thurlow St, but won't be serviced by it. This is acknowledged in the planning committee report for the FDS application, which says:

>"Whilst the AAAP envisaged a single energy centre being provided, the proposal is for an Energy Centre within Block 5 of the FDS with another energy centre being located close to the Albany Road/Thurlow Street junction as part of the Outline Scheme."

Policy BH6([II] - USE OF RENEWABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES) requires new developments in the core action area to provide a minimum 20% on-site renewable energy:

>"Developments should meet the London Plan target of a 20% reduction in CO2 emissions through the use of renewable technologies. Until such time as the CHP is fuelled by renewable energy sources and is capable of meeting the London Plan target, we will require developments to use their own CHP compatible on-site renewable energy technologies. 

The planning committee report for the application also acknowledges that the Scheme _"falls far short"_ of complying with this 20% minimum on-site renewable energy requirement:

>"Photovoltaic panels are proposed for the areas of roof that will achieve enough sunshine tomake them viable. Currently this stands at 697sqm. It is acknowledged that this represents a small proportion of the available roof space across the FDS however, as a result of the
townscape requirements that sought taller buildings on the park edge with heights reducing incrementally northwards, much of the remaining roof space is overshadowed by the taller elements to the south. The proposed photovoltaic panels will achieve a 3.72% carbon dioxide saving and whilst it is accepted that this falls far short of the 20% target it is accepted that this is an ambitious target to meet in a highly urbanised area." (Paragraph 365)

The 20% minimum on-site renewable energy requirement is not just a requirement of the AAAP, it is also a requirement of the AA's strategic planning framework [(Core Strategy)](http://www.2.southwark.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/13131/core_strategy_2011) and the London Plan.

@. Show how the sustainable energy requirements of the AAAP are not being adhered to on phase 1a (in breach of planning consent) - ie. biomass (see draft blog post on phase 1a having delivered gas boilers when it should have been biomass)

### The Scheme fails to comply with the development plan's sunlight/daylight requirements
It was pointed out during the previous inquiry that the (predominantly private?) tall buildings running east to west along the frontage to Burgess Park would result in the (predominantly affordable?) blocks behind them failing to meet BRE minimum daylight requirements.

Paragraph 5.223 of NHHT's planning statement explains that one of the reasons for the sunlight/daylight failure is because _"the development proposes the tall buildings along the park boundary to maximise the number of apartments with a view of the park".

@. Policy A6.5.5 of the AAAP says:

>"The frontage along Burgess Park must include a strong building line, allow for a range of heights and massing and include excellent architectural design. The park front should be designed to allow for light into rear courtyards and allow for views and glimpses from the park into the areas beyond the immediate front."

Policy A6.5.7 envisages that this will be achieved using a series of 'green fingers' - _"a series of multi-functional spaces that link with Burgess Park"_ : 

>"A series of ‘green fingers’ will be created, extending from Burgess Park into the action area core interlinking the park with the development. Their predominant function is that of a public space with social interaction, pedestrian and cycle movement dominating."

Besides enabling daylight, the AAAP envisages that the green fingers will provide access for emergency services and _"provide an important part of the overall public open space in the AAP area. They will extend Burgess Park into the residential development, allowing people to move easily from their homes to the park. They will also enable many more homes to have a frontage along pleasant green spaces. The green fingers will provide a range of functions including children’s play areas, water management and pedestrian and cycle movement."_ (policy 4.2.6)

![Extract from the AAAP](/img/greenfingerintersections.png)

@. The AAAP diagram for the order land shows one of the green fingers dissecting the FDS (10) and a second open space, Westmoreland Plaza (9) on the order land, but these were not included in the FDS planning consent.

![Extract from AAAP](http://35percent.org/img/fdsgreenfingers.png)

![integrate this with above image](/img/aaaplegend.png)

However, the planning application for the FDS Scheme and the outline masterplan have dropped the green fingers and the Westmoreland Plaza is now described in the planning documents as a 'pocket park'. 

![Extract from Design & Access Statement [CD43]](/img/fdsmodel.jpg)

The removal of the plaza and green finger from the Scheme means that the propsals for the order land will now suffer from the very problems that the AA has attributed to the estate in its grounds for redevelopment - lack of permeability, dark alleyways etc and will not enable the AAAP's objective of creating better quality open space/public realm. Moreover, the consented scheme will result in a significant net loss of open space.

### The Scheme fails to comply with the development plan's open space requirements
Policy PL5 (Open Space) of the AAAP says:

>"New development must provide a high quality network of public open spaces of different sizes and functions which link well together and contain good pedestrian and cycling routes."

@. Policy 4.5.1 of the AAAP envisages no net loss of open space, but the approved masterplan application (ref:14/AP/3844) acknowledges that there will be a net loss of 1.8 hectares of open space:

![Extract from the planning committee report for the masterplan application.](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/aylesburygreenspace.png)

@. Furthermore, the majority of the replacement open space will be privately managed. Only a small amount will be public open space adopted by the Council and most of this comprises just pavement on the perimeter of the new development.

![Extract from FDS planning application docs 15/AP/4584](/img/aylesburyopenspaces.png)

### The Scheme fails to comply with the development plan's private amenity space requirements
@. Policy PL7 of the AAAP says:

>"All development must contain high quality private open space in the form of communal gardens, private gardens and useable balconies.
The design of communal gardens should comply with the guidance in Appendix 6."

The appendix 6 refererred to in appendix 6 says:

>"All dwellings must have direct access to private open spaces, whether in the form of a garden, roof garden, courtyard or balcony. 1/2 bedroom dwellings must have a minimum of 6 sqm of private amenity space. Larger dwellings should aim to meet the minimum standards set out in the Residential Design Standards SPD."

The Residential Design Standards SPD requires 3 bed flats to have a minimum of 10sqm and _"For new housing, a minimum of 50sqm of private garden spaces is required and this should be at least 10m in length. The private gardens should extend across the entire width of the dwellings."_

Do the houses all have gardens and are they all 10m in length?

(table pg 40 of Planning Statement showing requirements.)


@. Policy A6.7.8 of the AAAP says _"At least 75% of apartments in each development should have dual aspect."_

@. How many of the homes in the new FDS application are due to be dual aspect?

### The Scheme fails to comply with the development plan's play space requirements
@. Policy PL6 of the AAAP says _"All development proposals must provide 10sqm of children’s play space / youth space per child bed space. Doorstep playable space should be provided within each of the housing blocks, whilst larger local playable spaces should be provided within selected housing blocks and within the green fingers and existing local parks, in accordance with Figure 12. New youth space should be provided within the larger areas of public open space."_

@. What does the new FDS application say about open space and play space?

Here's a link to the environmental statement: http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!pMsWP8tiTauKMmiQZaV9cQ%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d

### The Scheme fails to comply with the development plan's mixed use/retail requirements
@. AAAP policy __'COM6'__ requires the Scheme to _"Provide 1,750 square metres of new local retail facilities (convenience retail, cafes and restaurants) within the action area core"._

@. How much retail is being provided in the new FDS planning application? is it proportionate to achieving the 1,750 sqm across the masterplan site as a whole?
 
### The Scheme fails to comply with the development plan's density requirements
The AAAP says that this is the anticipated phasing strategy:

![Extract from AAAP](/img/anticipatedphasing.png)

@. The AAAP says _"The HCA has also recently admitted Aylesbury phases 2 and 3 to round 6 of the government backed Private Finance Initiative (PFI). Under this programme it is proposed that the council will effectively deliver 1000 new homes of which around 400 will be affordable council owned new homes"_.  

@. We know that the HCA PFI finance was scrapped shortly after the AAAP was adopted and we know that none of the new homes proposed will be Council owned. 

@. The AAAP says that 1419 units are required in phase 1, but given that only 408 units have been delivered on the other phase 1 sites [1a (261 units) & site 7 (147 units)] and only 840 units are proposed in the FDS application, then there is a shortfall of 171 between the number of units proposed on the Order Land and the number required by the AAAP.

![](http://35percent.org/img/aaapphasingdensity.png)  

@. The AAAP says that the scheme will deliver 1,450 extra new homes to contribute to the London Plan requirement of 16,300 new homes by 2016/2017. We can show that the scheme is providing less than the 1,450 promised and that Southwark has failed miserably to come anywhere near the 16,300 target.

![](http://35percent.org/img/aaapnewhomesdensity.png)  

@. Provide evidence showing the vast gap between the number of units required by more recent planning policy and the numbers being delivered. Show how supply shortage is fuelling the current housing crisis.

### The Scheme fails to comply with the development plan's room size requirements
@. The AAAP says that:

![](http://35percent.org/img/aaapsizeofhomes.png) 

But these extracts from the Housing Delivery Strategy 2016 says: http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!GB0ybg40uhtGW5vcbWkuZA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d

![](/img/fdshousing1.png)

Table here showing shortfall in 2,3,4, and 5 beds.

Does the FDS consent fall short of AH reqs by 50 units? is that why they have rejigged the planning apps?

![](/img/fdshousing2.png)

AAAP requires parker morris plus 10%. The Development specification gives some info about this - also compare existing floorspace against proposed floorspace. file://Desktop/Theca5a.pdf

### The Scheme fails to comply with the development plan's infrastructure funding requirements
@. Page 75 of the AAAP describes infrastructure funding. It says the developer will pay a tariff which will fund community facilities like the energy centre (£13m) and health centre (£4m). We now know that the Council is paying for the health centre from its own funds and that the energy centre is not being delivered.

@. The AAAP doesn't say what the tariff is.. it says that details of the tariff will be published in an SPD but I can't find any such SPD..

The main features of the objectives of the scheme underlying the CPO is the provision of an improved ..... Given that the proposed scheme will no longer achieve these objectives, the Order should not be confirmed. 

## The scheme underlying the Order is not viable and therefore not deliverable.
@. ODPM Circular 2005 says that the scheme underlying the order must be viable and therefore deliverable. (quote 2005 ODPM)

@. ODPM 2015 goes further to say "....."

@. Documents submitted to the examination in public of the AAAP, show that the Aylesbury scheme as envisaged is still not viable and that the viability gap is being bridged by shortchanging leaseholders. In Jan 2009, the [draft Aylesbury Area Action Plan](http://35percent.org/img/DraftAAAP.pdf) showed that there was a funding shortfall of £299m. 

![Page 92 of the [appendices](http://35percent.org/img/DraftAAAP_appendices.pdf) to the [draft AAAP](http://35percent.org/img/DraftAAAP.pdf)](http://35percent.org/img/DraftAAAP_appendices.png)

@. One of the key requirements of an Area Action Plan is that it must be shown to be viable and therefore deliverable. The inspector at the examination in public of Southwark's AAAP, [flagged up](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/352116/response/873296/attach/3/160926%20EIR%20FOI%20685920.pdf) the significant funding gap to the Council and her [final report](http://35percent.org/img/AAAP_inspectors_report.pdf) on the AAAP shows that the Council's solution was to arbitrarily slash the cost estimates, without providing any evidence base or justification for doing so. The £130m originally estimated for leasehold acquisitions of the circa 500 leasehold properties on the estate was slashed by half. There is no explanation as to why the Council slashed its estimate of the market value of leaseholders' homes by 50% overnight. 

![[Table of Recommended Changes to AAAP (2009)](http://35percent.org/img/Table_of_Recommended_Changes.pdf) showing cost estimates slashed](http://35percent.org/img/Recommended_Changes.png)

@. Altogether, the cost estimates were reduced by around a half, reducing the funding gap from £299m down to £169m and this is the figure given in the [final adopted version of the AAAP](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/downloads/download/4444/area_action_plans). 

![Extract from final adopted version of [Aylesbury Area Action Plan 2010](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/downloads/download/4444/area_action_plans) showing the funding gap](http://35percent.org/img/aaapfundinggap.png)

@. The Acquiring Authority was expecting to cover the funding shortfall with government PFI funding and this is how the Area Action Plan was deemed sound at its Examination in Public. However, just under a year after the Area Action Plan was adopted, the government [withdrew](http://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/dec/26/cut-regeneration-tony-blair-housing) all PFI funding for the scheme. 

@. The Acquiring Authority has rejected calls for it to publish its viability assessment for the scheme underlying the Order. In response to the requirement to show "general funding sources..." the Acquiring Authority has argued that its development partner NHHT will make up for the funding shortfall using reserves from its £xxm surplus. The Objectors submit that this would have knock-on effects on its credit rating and negatively affect its borrowing costs. NHHT is due to experience substantial debt growth over the next fiver years, rising from £1.3m in 2016 to £2.3bn in 2021. According to credit rating agency Moodys, over the next five years, growth in interest expense will outpace growth in surpluses. 

@. In June 2016 NHHT was [downgraded](http://35percent.org/img/nhhtmoodys.pdf) by Moodys. Moodys' downgrade notice mentioned NHHT's significant development pipeline and its three major schemes; the Aylesbury estate, Canada Water and a scheme in Hounslow. 

@. The Moodys report states that just 7% of the homes in NHHT's pipeline are social rent. So the replacement 'social' homes on the FDS must have been included in these figures as affordable rent. To conclude: Moody's capex to revenue ratio must have been based on the provision of affordable rent not social rent. Had it been based on social rent then the capex to revenue ratio would have been much higher. So either Moodys have been given incorrect info on the tenure mix of NHHT's pipeline or the replacement 'social' homes on the Aylesbury will be affordable rent..

![Extract from Moodys downgrading [announcement](http://35percent.org/img/nhhtmoodys.pdf)](http://35percent.org/img/nhhtmoodys.png)  

@. In paragraph xxx of its Statement of Case, the Acquiring Authority has inferred that the Scheme has received funding from the GLA. However, its £26m? funding allocation under the GLA's 2014-16? Affordable Homes Programme is now compromised by the fact that phasing for the FDS has been delayed and will not be completed until 2024 [(See here)](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s68300/Appendix%202%20Draft%20development%20agreement.pdf) (funding requirement is that the scheme is completed before March 2019?). 

@. In paragraph xxx of its Statement of Case, the Acquiring Authority has asserted that £76m of its own funds have been set aside for the scheme over the next five years. However, it does not explain that this covers only site assembly - i.e. leaseholder compensation, decant and rehousing costs, demolition etc. Given that there is no funding for construction of the Scheme, then it cannot be claimed to be viable at the consented tenure mix. 

@. The Moodys downgrade report confirmed that on average NHHT is delivering 7% social rented housing across schemes in its current pipeline and this is despite NHHT having received record levels of funding (£92m - GLA?). 

@. The Objectors submit that in the absence of dedicated government or GLA funding to replace the PFI funding anticipated at the time the AAAP was drafted, the minimum 37.5% social rented housing across the Aylesbury scheme us undeliverable.

@. The Objectors submit that if the Order as it stands is confirmed, then the shortfall will be made up both by continuing to shortchange leaseholders and passing off affordable rented tenure as social rent.

@. This has indeed been the fate of several other schemes completed by NHHT. It was shown at the previous inquiry how NHHT had delivered affordable rented homes at up to 62% market rent at its Bermondsey Spa regeneration, when social rent was agreed in the DPA, planning committee report and section 106 agreement.

@. The same is true of NHHT's regeneration of the xxx estate in neighbouring Lambeth. This was ......

Affordable rent was introduced in 2011 to allow housing associations to charge higher rents (up to 80% market rent) to its tenants. The mayor has recently introduced several other social housing tenures, including 'London Living Rent' and 'London Affordable Rent'.  
The AAAP specifically requires that a minimum 37.5% of the new homes must be social rent. At the time the AAAP was drafted social rent was the only rented social housing tenure. The AAAP predates affordable rent and the other new tenures that have been created. The AAAP specifically states its aim as to help 'most vulnerable' to remain in area - to rehouse tenants on the estate footprint etc. and this is why it specified such a high proportion of social rented homes that would guarantee remained affordable for existing tenants.

Given the deregulation of the housing association sector which has ensued after the AAAP was adopted, it is no surprise that existing Aylesbury tenants are not taking up the replacement 'social housing' on the completed phases. Of the xxx tenants decanted from the FDS, only xx have been rehoused on the footprint and of the xxx decanted from the next phase  (phase 2) only 34 have been rehoused on the footprint. 

The fear over rising housing association rents is exacerbated not just by the sudden deregulation of the sector but also fierce lobbying by housing association to be able to increase rents as they see fit. 

NHHT is one of the most active lobbyists among housing associations. In 2007, its CEO Kate Davies - then a member of the thinktank CSJ along with Iain Duncan Smith, co-authored a paper in which she wrote:

>"State provided solutionss...

>"Housing associations should be free to set their own rent..

In 2011, when the government introduced its controversial affordable rent tenure, allowing social rents to be increased to up to 80% market rent, NHHT wrote in its official response to the govt consultation:

>"bla bla we really support this" 

## Tenure switch
@. Submit copy of [Southwark's evidence](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/CPO_ExplanatoryNote12May2015.pdf) from previous Inquiry where they claim to have robust S106 monitoring procedures.

![Extract from Southwark's [evidence to first Inquiry](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/CPO_ExplanatoryNote12May2015.pdf)](http://35percent.org/img/CPO_ExplanatoryNote.png)

@. Submit copy of [Ombudsman decision](http://35percent.org/2016-12-12-ombudsman-slams-southwark-for-no-s106-monitoring/) and Sunday Times [article](http://35percent.org/img/ST23April2017.pdf) showing Southwark's failure to monitor S106 AH tenure delivery, as a result of it not having any monitoring procedures. Show how it therefore misled the previous Inquiry with its evidence claiming to have robust monitoring procedures.

@. Highlight NHHT's other developments where social rent intended but affordable rent delivered - i.e. the one in Lambeth delivered on the [Claremont East estate](http://35percent.org/2017-01-16-draft-more-on-notting-hill/#claremont-east-estate-lambeth).

@. Show how the breach at Bermondsey Spa hasn't been resolved, i.e. the Council hasn't taken effective action to recover the SR homes - i.e. there still remains a net loss across the Bermondsey Spa and Manor Place Depot sites.  

@. Re-run all of our previous criticisms of Kate Davies and her predeliction for affordable rent and privatisation. Include also Steve Hilditch's recent [article](https://redbrickblog.wordpress.com/2017/01/07/one-article-does-not-wipe-the-slate-clean/) criticising Davies and Notting Hill (Hilditch is a former NHHT board member).

>"Social housing is not a desirable destination.. Private ownership is preferable to state-provided solutions". (Kate Davies, CEO of NHHT - 2008)

![CSJ report recommendations (co-authored by Kate Davies)](http://35percent.org/img/csjquoterents.png)  

## Bashing NHHT 
@. Submit the  on NHHT's rent hikes and evictions at its St. James estate in Bermondsey. Include MP Neil Coyle's criticisms and Cllr Pollak's quote saying NHHT is acting like a 'predatory landlord'. 

![[Southwark News article, 6/10/16](https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/housing-association-slammed-nightmare-scenario-eviction-threat-bermondseys-st-james-estate/)](http://35percent.org/img/nhhtevictions.png)  

@. Highlight NHHT's profit margin in the DPA.

@. Show how Wood Dene estate and Decathlon sites appear to have stalled. Point out affordable scandal at the Decathlon site (blog post to be drafted still) and the low level of social rented housing at the Wood Dene site. Make the point that NHHT successfully argued (using viability assessments) that it wasn't viable to provide more than the pitiful 15% (avg) social rented housing across both sites. So how can it be possible that the FDS site can viably provide over 40% social rented?

@. Include evidence on the Silwood estate and the 3 missing social rented housing units that NHHT should have delivered according to the planning consent and S106 agreement.

@. Show HCA/GLA stats showing how many thousands of homes NHHT has converted to affordable rent. 

## Scheme in breach of Equalities Impact mitigation measures (and consequently PSED)
The AAAP said there will be a 'range of options to enable leaseholders to stay in area, buy into new scheme etc..'

@. This was discussed in more detail in the Equalities Assessment conducted in conjunction with the AAAP.
(the [2009 EqIA which accommpanied the AAAP](http://35percent.org/img/EqualitiesImpactAssessment.pdf)), relied upon the mitigation measures in place at the time for leaseholders- i.e. the rehousing options enshrined in the Council's [2006 rehousing policy](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/1850/executive_report) which included the like-for-like 'propery swap' for leaseholders. The 2006 policy and the Council's [Handbook for leaseholders](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/331856/response/818864/attach/3/64145%20RedR%20Homeowner.pdf) clearly state the 'property swap' as one of the available rehousing options:

![Extract from the [Leaseholders Handbook](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/331856/response/818864/attach/3/64145%20RedR%20Homeowner.pdf)](http://35percent.org/img/aylesburyleaseholdershandbookoptions.png)

@. The handbook gives a detailed description of the property swap policy available to leaseholders:

![Extract from the [Leaseholders Handbook](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/331856/response/818864/attach/3/64145%20RedR%20Homeowner.pdf)](http://35percent.org/img/aylesburyhandbookswap.png)

@. The EqIA specifically references the 2006 rehousing policy for leaseholders which it says offers leaseholders the _'widest possible choice of rehousing opportunities'_:

![](http://35percent.org/img/spiritofcooperation.png)  

![](http://35percent.org/img/widestpossiblechoice.png)  

@. Given that the 'property swap' option was subsequently withdrawn in 2010, it can be argued that the scheme doesn't comply with the PSED because one of the mitigation measures set out in the EqIA which underlies the AAAP has been withdrawn. Indeed it was the only mitigation measure that would have enabled leaseholders to remain 100% homeowners in the borough - i.e. not impoverished by the shared ownership options. 

@. Inspector Coffey said that leaseholders are left with two bleak options: moving out of the area or remaining but being impoverished. Like-for-like swap was the only option that would have enabled leaseholders to remain in the area without being impoverished. *We will need to show that the shared equity deal impoverishes leaseholders despite change in the £16k policy. (Investigate service charges etc)*



## DPA provisions breached
@. NHHT has breached various provisions in the DPA including its obligation to purchase 5 street properties that it was to offer on shared equity terms to leaseholders in phase 1b/1c. The Council claims in its response to our Cabinet question that NHHT has indeed provided 2 such properties to leaseholders on the FDS. We should seek more details of this and ask why these were not offered to Beverley and Agnes.

@. The following changes to the funding programme show how NHHT is rolling back on its funding commitments to the scheme. In September 2016, Southwark [agreed](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s63817/Report.Aylesbury%20Regeneration%20Delivery.pdf) a number of changes to the development agreement with NHHT. Southwark agreed to forward fund £21m of the ongoing costs of progressing the scheme, that NHHT was originally required to fund under the terms of the Development Partnership Agreement. These comprised:

> * £16.8m demolition costs for the First Development Site
> * £0.8m for the demolition of Plot 18
> * £2m to underwrite the cost of Plot 18’s planning application
> * £2m to underwrite the design fees for phase 2

@. These costs are in addition to the Council’s other costs that it has already agreed to allocate to the scheme. In total the Council is now forecast to spend £52.5m over the next three years on the Aylesbury redevelopment scheme.

@. Notting Hill Housing’s commitment to the scheme is also plainly a concern. The [Cabinet report](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s63817/Report.Aylesbury%20Regeneration%20Delivery.pdf) goes on to say that _‘if the scheme has not proceeded in accordance with the DPA (Development Partnership Agreement)’_ then _‘at that point all design work will pass to the council enabling the council to market the site’_(para. 13) - in plain language: if Notting Hill drops out then Southwark takes over and looks for another developer. 

@. NHHT is also now [reducing](http://www.aylesburynow.london/news/posts/extra-affordable-homes-for-aylesbury-regeneration) the number of affordable units in plot 18, its first phase of development to be completed on the estate. It is moving these to be delivered instead on the FDS. Note that the [9 May Cabinet report](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s68298/Report%20Aylesbury%20Regeneration%20Programme%20Delivery.pdf) announced a change of phasing: the FDS has been swapped with plot 18 - i.e. the FDS will instead be the second phase of development completed by NHHT after plot 18. Fresh planning applications for both sites are expected shortly.

@. The Objectors submit that the number of social housing units on plot 18 has been reduced as a result of viability issues. The Objectors submit that this will be the fate of the FDS.

## The scheme will not be delivered in a reasonable time period 
@. Circular ODPM/2005 says that there needs to be evidence that the scheme underlying the Order will be completed in a 'reasonable' time period; we need to look up case identifying how 'reasonable time period' is to be interpreted.

@. Show how [Wood Dene estate](http://35percent.org/wood-dene-estate-regeneration/) was demolished in 2007 and how NHHT has [left the site empty](https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/notting-hill-admits-wood-dene-estate-peckham-wont-rebuilt-2019-thirteen-years-demolition/) for 10 years without building any new homes. This will be the future of phase 1b/1c.

@. The DPA says that the FDS will be completed by 2021, but NHHT have now put this back to 2024. See [here](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s68300/Appendix%202%20Draft%20development%20agreement.pdf).

## Refurb/Alternative to scheme underlying the CPO 

Work out how much AA receives in rental income from tenants on the estate. Say it should use this on refurb/maintenance instead of £100k salaries for PR managers (Tony Mainwairing). 

Paragraph 1.2.4 of the AAAP says that the estate needs to be redeveloped because "it would cost too much to bring the homes up to
decent homes standards".

The Sep 2005 Cabinet report which informed this decision said that the cost of bringing homes up to DHS would be £93m, which included £13m for repairing/replacing the heating system. This has already been committed and £xxm has been spent on bringing xx number of homes up to DHS already. 

This is confirmed in Council briefing papers and also Para 360 of the OR for the planning application for the FDS, which says: "The heating system has become more reliable recently due to upgrades to pipework and other pieces of equipment."

Given that the AAAP was drafted on the basis of the 2005 data, i.e. before significant improvement works were undertaken and that given the extent of these works undertaken in the meantime, the estate is now less needy of redevlopment than it was at the time of the AAAP.

Southwark Council's own report in 2015, carried out by by the council's Principal Design and Technical officer Catherine Bates, said, "The condition of the buildings on the estate does not, itself, present a case for demolition and redevelopment."

Inspector should discount the current condition of buildings on the Order Land
Any actual or perceived failure in the local housing market that may exist is partly attributable to, or in the alternative has been exacerbated by, the activities of the Acquiring Authority and its partners. Therefore no reliance can be placed upon the Acquiring Authority’s evidence in this respect. Properties that have already been purchased voluntarily by the Acquiring Authority, or by its development partners, have not been occupied subsequent to their acquisition. Instead, they have been secured but left in a manner which fosters an impression of dereliction and decay, with consequent blighting effects, under which ambitions for compulsory purchase of additional land might be considered to be more readily achievable. The Acquiring Authority has therefore attempted to present a fait accompli. Accordingly the Inspector cannot place any reliance on circumstances created by the Acquiring Authority. Further, these properties have not been demolished, thus implying a lack of confidence in the scheme underlying the CPO on the part of the Acquiring Authority or its development partners.

@. [This report](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s56449/Report%20Major%20works%20status%20report%20incorporating%20Warm%20Dry%20and%20Safe.pdf) describes different funding for DHS works, including the 'GLA Backlog fund' and the [accompanying appendices](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s56450/Appendices%201%20-%204%20Major%20works%20status%20report%20incorporating%20Warm%20Dry%20and%20Safe.pdf) show that the Four Squares estate (a High Investment Needs estate) was brought up to DHS for just £12m. Work out how much this is per unit and also show similar comparables.

@. On the question of sources of funding a refurb scheme, one could also include the Section 106 off-site pooled funding and that set aside for new Council homes. Refurbishment would also help the Council save on the [£10m per year it is having to spend on temporary accommodation](https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/council-spend-temporary-housing-now-five-times-20112012/):

@. [This Cabinet item](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieIssueDetails.aspx?IId=11030&Opt=3) from 2011 gives details of 'High Investment Needs estates' and gives cost estimates of DHS works. 

@. Appendix 6 of the Cabinet item shows the Aylesbury as not being the most costly of the estates. We could find out the actual costs of other estates on the list and do a comparison. Here's the [link to appendix 6](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s19628/Appendix%206%20List%20of%2015%20High%20Investment%20Needs%20Estates.pdf)

@. Southwark has in any case already [committed £12.5m to Major Works](http://35percent.org/img/Aylesbury-Phase-2-newsletter-February-2017-JH.pdf) bringing homes on phase 3/4 of the estate up to Decent Homes Standard.

An alternative scheme (referred to as ‘Plan B’ in the Statement of Reasons for making the CPO) has been promoted by a group of local stakeholders, using the acronym xxx. The scheme proposed by xxx is clearly superior to that of the Acquiring Authority. It would require less funding, would be less intrusive and would meet the Acquiring Authority’s objective of achieving an improved.

Conclusion: 
The AAAP envisaged redevelopment because at the time it was assumed that "it would cost too much to bring the homes up to
decent homes standards". It asserted that redevlopement would also enable an uplift in density to 4200 new homes and that these would be of better quality in terms of environment and sustainability. Given that the scheme fails to conform with these objectives and given the significant number of homes brought up to DHS in the interim ...

Also, given the fact that redevelopment has proven to be more costly and DHS works less costly...

Council has spent £46m redeveloping just 112 homes and has allocated £96m over next five years. This would be sufficient to bring xx homes on the Order Land up tp DHS.

### Displacement
@. How many rehoused on estate footprint as per EqIA and AAAP intention?

@. Why have only 10 of the estate's 200 leaseholders decanted to date taken up the shared equity offer? Where did the rest of the leaseholders go?

## Compensation issues
@. The Council acknowledges that the value of homes on the Aylesbury are lower than any other properties in the borough and that their shared ownership options are a recognition of this.

@. The [minutes of 10/03/2014 Overview and Scrutiny Committee](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/mgAi.aspx?ID=32015) confirm that the Council's principal surveyor said _"The council’s ownership schemes were in recognition of the fact that the price offered might not enable a leaseholder to buy another property."_

@. In his [report](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s44932/Officer%20Report%20-%20Comparison%20of%20Discretionary%20Assistance%20Given%20to%20Resident%20Leaseholders.pdf) to that Committee, the Principal Surveyor said _"Some  Councils  offer  equivalent  exchange  whereby  a  leaseholder  swops his/her property for another of the same value.  This has been considered but the properties being regenerated in this Borough tend to be at the lowest level of the value scale. There are unlikely to be similar equivalents that aren’t part of regeneration schemes so such an offer would be hollow. "_  

## Rehousing options
@. In his [evidence](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/Mark_Maginn.pdf) to the site 7 CPO inquiry, Mark Maginn explains that leaseholders are assessed for rehousing on a 'cascade' basis; i.e. they are assessed to see if they can afford shared ownership before being considered for shared equity or other rehousing options. Given that shared ownership is much less attractive and more costly than shared equity, it is no surprise that only 10 of the over 200 leaseholders decanted have qualified for and taken up shared equity.

@. Request stock condition survey mentioned here: Paragraph  25  details  the  stock  condition  survey  undertaken  in  2010  which  has provided  the  most  robust  and  extensive  information  to date  on  the  state  of  the Council's  housing  stock. http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s19609/Report%20Housing%20investment%20programme%20and%20revised%20strategy.pdf

Request details of rehousing:
How many leaseholders rehoused as tenants? where? RSL etc?
How many shared ownership/equity etc.
Where did they go?

Creation Trust displacement map for phase 2 - how many tenants rehoused on footprint? Where did leaseholders go?

Ask whether an agreement with the MoJ has been signed for the relocation of Ellison House - if so ask for a copy of the agreement.

Ask whether the Council has sold any properties on the estate at auction. It is understood that the Council has bought back properties on later phases and subsequently sold them at auction rather than let them to temporary licencees.

Ask for details on the leaseholder who died in Arlow. How did he die? was it result of environmental conditions - i.e. discontinuity in services - heating?

Check DPA and ask for viability review of plot 18 - i.e. the viability assessment showing it is viable.

Are there any reports required by the DPA that we can make a request for - or meetings of yearly scheduled meetings related to the DPA?

Request tenure delivery information: has the AA checked what tenure was delivered on completed phases? it claimed to have done so at the Oct 2015 INquiry but we now know that was a lie. Has the AA completed audit and what are the results for phase 1a and site 7?

Biomass? was it delivered?

[Hilmi letter telling him qualifies for shared ownership](/img/hilmisharedownership.pdf)
[Letter](/img/lettersenttowolvertonleaseholders.pdf) with Jane Seymour saying that re-housing offers will be withdrawn once CPO procedures start.

Conclusion:
In summary, the Acquiring Authority action in making the CPO is oppressive, it has no statutory powers compulsorily to acquire the Objector’s land or to develop a highway as the principal element of the regeneration proposals. The Acquiring Authority has also failed to comply with several requirements identified in Circular 06/2004. If, contrary to the above, the CPO is confirmed, it is clearly vulnerable to further challenge in the High Court under s.23 of the Acquisition of Land Act 1981, which could result in the CPO being quashed.

The CPO should therefore be withdrawn forthwith to avoid any further wasted costs.
