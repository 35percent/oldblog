## The Scheme for the Order Land is no longer in accordance with the statutory development plan
@. The compulsory purchase code requires that the Scheme underlying the Order is in conformity with the statutory development plan. The statutory development plan context for the Scheme underlying this Order (“the Scheme”) is the Aylesbury Area Action Plan 2010 (“AAAP”) (CD 2).

### Scheme in breach of Sustainable Energy requirements
Whilst the AAAP envisaged a single energy centre being provided, the proposal is for an Energy Centre within
Block 5 of the FDS with another energy centre being located close to the Albany
Road/Thurlow Street junction as part of the Outline Scheme.

@. Show how the sustainable energy requirements of the AAAP are not being adhered to - ie. biomass (see draft blog post on phase 1a having delivered gas boilers when it should have been biomass)

@. [This press release](http://www.24housing.co.uk/news/first-new-homes-completed-on-aylesbury-estate/) says that biomass was to be provided on phase 1a but we know from classeur blog post that biomass was never provided. The planning committee report and s106 for phase 1a also stipulated biomass.

@. AAAP policy BH7 says _"All new homes within the action area core should meet Code for Sustainable Homes Level 4 up to 2016 and Level 6 beyond"_.  

@. But in its [Energy Strategy](http://35percent.org/img/aylesburyenergystrategy2.pdf) submitted pursuant to conditions of the S106 agreement, NHHT says that the zero carbon homes requirement has been removed (16/AP/2887).

OR365 says: Photovoltaic panels are proposed for the areas of roof that will achieve enough sunshine to
make them viable. Currently this stands at 697sqm. It is acknowledged that this represents a
small proportion of the available roof space across the FDS however, as a result of the
townscape requirements that sought taller buildings on the park edge with heights reducing
incrementally northwards, much of the remaining roof space is overshadowed by the taller
elements to the south. The proposed photovoltaic panels will achieve a 3.72% carbon dioxide
saving and whilst it is accepted that this falls far short of the 20% target it is accepted that
this is an ambitious target to meet in a highly urbanised area

### Scheme in breach of BRE Sunlight/Daylight requirements
@. See what the new FDS application does about the BRE sunlight/daylight issues. Given the density it will be difficult to resolve.

@. Policy A6.7.8 of the AAAP says _"At least 75% of apartments in each development should have dual aspect."_

@. How many of the homes in the new FDS application are due to be dual aspect?

### Scheme in breach of public realm requirements
@. The AAAP says that there will be a 21 metre-wide 'community spine' running east to west through the site. This will provide a cycle and pedestrian route throughout the entire site, connecting the new community facilities to the Walworth road. It also says there will be three 'green fingers' extending in to the estate from Burgess Park, providing public green space and pedestrian/cycle access. Furthermore it lists a public plaza 'Westmoreland Rd Plaza' on the order land.

![Extract from AAAP](http://35percent.org/img/communityspine.png)

@. The AAAP diagram for the order land shows the community spine (3), one of the green fingers dissecting the FDS (10) and Westmoreland Plaza (9) on the order land, but these were not included in the existing FDS planning consent. Does the new application include these?

![Extract from AAAP](http://35percent.org/img/fdsgreenfingers.png)

@. The New Southwark Plan (the Council's strategic planning framework) says that there will be a 'Southwark Spine', dedicated cycle route running North/South through the borough and passing through the middle of the new Aylesbury estate. But this was not included in the masterplan application.

@. Also to my knowledge, the previous FDS application didn't include any segregated cycle routes - we need to see what the new application says about cycle routes.

### Scheme in breach of Open Space requirements
@. Policy 4.5.1 of the AAAP envisages no net loss of open space, but the approved masterplan application (ref:14/AP/3844) acknowledges that there will be a net loss of 1.8 hectares of open space:

![Extract from the planning committee report for the masterplan application.](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/aylesburygreenspace.png)

@. Also, the replacement open space will be gated - see Harvard Gardens.

### Scheme in breach of Play Space requirements
@. Policy PL6 of the AAAP says _"All development proposals must provide 10sqm of children’s play space / youth space per child bed space. Doorstep playable space should be provided within each of the housing blocks, whilst larger local playable spaces should be provided within selected housing blocks and within the green fingers and existing local parks, in accordance with Figure 12. New youth space should be provided within the larger areas of public open space."_

@. What does the new FDS application say about open space and play space?

### Scheme in breach of Mixed use/retail requirements
@. AAAP policy __'COM6'__ says that the Scheme must _"Provide 1,750 square metres of new local retail facilities (convenience retail, cafes and restaurants) within the action area core"._

@. How much retail is being provided in the new FDS planning application? is it proportionate to achieving the 1,750 sqm across the masterplan site as a whole?
 
### Scheme in breach of Density requirements
@. The AAAP says _"The HCA has also recently admitted Aylesbury phases 2 and 3 to round 6 of the government backed Private Finance Initiative (PFI). Under this programme it is proposed that the council will effectively deliver 1000 new homes of which around 400 will be affordable council owned new homes"_.  

@. We know that the HCA PFI finance was scrapped shortly after the AAAP was adopted and we know that none of the new homes proposed will be Council owned. 

@. The AAAP says that 1419 units are required in phase 1, but given that only 408 units have been delivered on the other phase 1 sites [1a (261 units) & site 7 (147 units)] and only 840 units are proposed in the FDS application, then there is a shortfall of 171 between the number of units proposed on the Order Land and the number required by the AAAP.

![](http://35percent.org/img/aaapphasingdensity.png)  

@. The AAAP says that the scheme will deliver 1,450 extra new homes to contribute to the London Plan requirement of 16,300 new homes by 2016/2017. We can show that the scheme is providing less than the 1,450 promised and that Southwark has failed miserably to come anywhere near the 16,300 target.

![](http://35percent.org/img/aaapnewhomesdensity.png)  

@. Provide evidence showing the vast gap between the number of units required by more recent planning policy and the numbers being delivered. Show how supply shortage is fuelling the current housing crisis.

### Scheme in breach of Room Size requirements
@. The AAAP says that:

![](http://35percent.org/img/aaapsizeofhomes.png)  

@. Does the accommodation schedule in the new planning application for the FDS conform with these requirements?

### Scheme in breach of Infrastructure funding requirements
@. Page 75 of the AAAP describes infrastructure funding. It says the developer will pay a tariff which will fund community facilities like the energy centre (£13m) and health centre (£4m). We now know that the Council is paying for the health centre from its own funds and that the energy centre is not being delivered.

@. The AAAP doesn't say what the tariff is.. it says that details of the tariff will be published in an SPD but I can't find any such SPD..

## The scheme underlying the Order is not viable and therefore not deliverable.
@. ODPM Circular 2005 says that the scheme underlying the order must be viable and therefore deliverable. (quote 2005 ODPM)

@. ODPM 2015 goes further to say "....."

@. Documents submitted to the examination in public of the AAAP, show that the Aylesbury scheme as envisaged is still not viable and that the viability gap is being bridged by shortchanging leaseholders. In Jan 2009, the [draft Aylesbury Area Action Plan](http://35percent.org/img/DraftAAAP.pdf) showed that there was a funding shortfall of £299m. 

![Page 92 of the [appendices](http://35percent.org/img/DraftAAAP_appendices.pdf) to the [draft AAAP](http://35percent.org/img/DraftAAAP.pdf)](http://35percent.org/img/DraftAAAP_appendices.png)

@. One of the key requirements of an Area Action Plan is that it must be shown to be viable and therefore deliverable. The inspector at the examination in public of Southwark's AAAP, [flagged up](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/352116/response/873296/attach/3/160926%20EIR%20FOI%20685920.pdf) the significant funding gap to the Council and her [final report](http://35percent.org/img/AAAP_inspectors_report.pdf) on the AAAP shows that the Council's solution was to arbitrarily slash the cost estimates, without providing any evidence base or justification for doing so. The £130m originally estimated for leasehold acquisitions of the circa 500 leasehold properties on the estate was slashed by half. There is no explanation as to why the Council slashed its estimate of the market value of leaseholders' homes by 50% overnight. 

![[Table of Recommended Changes to AAAP (2009)](http://35percent.org/img/Table_of_Recommended_Changes.pdf) showing cost estimates slashed](http://35percent.org/img/Recommended_Changes.png)

@. Altogether, the cost estimates were reduced by around a half, reducing the funding gap from £299m down to £169m and this is the figure given in the [final adopted version of the AAAP](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/downloads/download/4444/area_action_plans). 

![Extract from final adopted version of [Aylesbury Area Action Plan 2010](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/downloads/download/4444/area_action_plans) showing the funding gap](http://35percent.org/img/aaapfundinggap.png)

@. The Acquiring Authority was expecting to cover the funding shortfall with government PFI funding and this is how the Area Action Plan was deemed sound at its Examination in Public. However, just under a year after the Area Action Plan was adopted, the government [withdrew](http://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/dec/26/cut-regeneration-tony-blair-housing) all PFI funding for the scheme. 

@. The Acquiring Authority has rejected calls for it to publish its viability assessment for the scheme underlying the Order. In response to the requirement to show "general funding sources..." the Acquiring Authority has argued that its development partner NHHT will make up for the funding shortfall using reserves from its £xxm surplus. The Objectors submit that this would have knock-on effects on its credit rating and negatively affect its borrowing costs. NHHT is due to experience substantial debt growth over the next fiver years, rising from £1.3m in 2016 to £2.3bn in 2021. According to credit rating agency Moodys, over the next five years, growth in interest expense will outpace growth in surpluses. 

@. In June 2016 NHHT was [downgraded](http://35percent.org/img/nhhtmoodys.pdf) by Moodys. Moodys' downgrade notice mentioned NHHT's significant development pipeline and its three major schemes; the Aylesbury estate, Canada Water and a scheme in Hounslow. 

@. The Moodys report states that just 7% of the homes in NHHT's pipeline are social rent. So the replacement 'social' homes on the FDS must have been included in these figures as affordable rent. To conclude: Moody's capex to revenue ratio must have been based on the provision of affordable rent not social rent. Had it been based on social rent then the capex to revenue ratio would have been much higher. So either Moodys have been given incorrect info on the tenure mix of NHHT's pipeline or the replacement 'social' homes on the Aylesbury will be affordable rent..

![Extract from Moodys downgrading [announcement](http://35percent.org/img/nhhtmoodys.pdf)](http://35percent.org/img/nhhtmoodys.png)  

@. In paragraph xxx of its Statement of Case, the Acquiring Authority has inferred that the Scheme has received funding from the GLA. However, its £26m? funding allocation under the GLA's 2014-16? Affordable Homes Programme is now compromised by the fact that phasing for the FDS has been delayed and will not be completed until 2024 [(See here)](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s68300/Appendix%202%20Draft%20development%20agreement.pdf) (funding requirement is that the scheme is completed before March 2019?). 

@. In paragraph xxx of its Statement of Case, the Acquiring Authority has asserted that £76m of its own funds have been set aside for the scheme over the next five years. However, it does not explain that this covers only site assembly - i.e. leaseholder compensation, decant and rehousing costs, demolition etc. Given that there is no funding for construction of the Scheme, then it cannot be claimed to be viable at the consented tenure mix. 

@. The Moodys downgrade report confirmed that on average NHHT is delivering 7% social rented housing across schemes in its current pipeline and this is despite NHHT having received record levels of funding (£92m - GLA?). 

@. The Objectors submit that in the absence of dedicated government or GLA funding to replace the PFI funding anticipated at the time the AAAP was drafted, the minimum 37.5% social rented housing across the Aylesbury scheme us undeliverable.

@. The Objectors submit that if the Order as it stands is confirmed, then the shortfall will be made up both by continuing to shortchange leaseholders and passing off affordable rented tenure as social rent.

@. This has indeed been the fate of several other schemes completed by NHHT. It was shown at the previous inquiry how NHHT had delivered affordable rented homes at up to 62% market rent at its Bermondsey Spa regeneration, when social rent was agreed in the DPA, planning committee report and section 106 agreement.

@. The same is true of NHHT's regeneration of the xxx estate in neighbouring Lambeth. This was ......

Affordable rent was introduced in 2011 to allow housing associations to charge higher rents (up to 80% market rent) to its tenants. The mayor has recently introduced several other social housing tenures, including 'London Living Rent' and 'London Affordable Rent'.  
The AAAP specifically requires that a minimum 37.5% of the new homes must be social rent. At the time the AAAP was drafted social rent was the only rented social housing tenure. The AAAP predates affordable rent and the other new tenures that have been created. The AAAP specifically states its aim as to help 'most vulnerable' to remain in area - to rehouse tenants on the estate footprint etc. and this is why it specified such a high proportion of social rented homes that would guarantee remained affordable for existing tenants.

Given the deregulation of the housing association sector which has ensued after the AAAP was adopted, it is no surprise that existing Aylesbury tenants are not taking up the replacement 'social housing' on the completed phases. Of the xxx tenants decanted from the FDS, only xx have been rehoused on the footprint and of the xxx decanted from the next phase  (phase 2) only 34 have been rehoused on the footprint. 

The fear over rising housing association rents is exacerbated not just by the sudden deregulation of the sector but also fierce lobbying by housing association to be able to increase rents as they see fit. 

NHHT is one of the most active lobbyists among housing associations. In 2007, its CEO Kate Davies - then a member of the thinktank CSJ along with Iain Duncan Smith, co-authored a paper in which she wrote:

>"State provided solutionss...

>"Housing associations should be free to set their own rent..

In 2011, when the government introduced its controversial affordable rent tenure, allowing social rents to be increased to up to 80% market rent, NHHT wrote in its official response to the govt consultation:

>"bla bla we really support this" 

## Tenure switch
@. Submit copy of [Southwark's evidence](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/CPO_ExplanatoryNote12May2015.pdf) from previous Inquiry where they claim to have robust S106 monitoring procedures.

![Extract from Southwark's [evidence to first Inquiry](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/CPO_ExplanatoryNote12May2015.pdf)](http://35percent.org/img/CPO_ExplanatoryNote.png)

@. Submit copy of [Ombudsman decision](http://35percent.org/2016-12-12-ombudsman-slams-southwark-for-no-s106-monitoring/) and Sunday Times [article](http://35percent.org/img/ST23April2017.pdf) showing Southwark's failure to monitor S106 AH tenure delivery, as a result of it not having any monitoring procedures. Show how it therefore misled the previous Inquiry with its evidence claiming to have robust monitoring procedures.

@. Highlight NHHT's other developments where social rent intended but affordable rent delivered - i.e. the one in Lambeth delivered on the [Claremont East estate](http://35percent.org/2017-01-16-draft-more-on-notting-hill/#claremont-east-estate-lambeth).

@. Show how the breach at Bermondsey Spa hasn't been resolved, i.e. the Council hasn't taken effective action to recover the SR homes - i.e. there still remains a net loss across the Bermondsey Spa and Manor Place Depot sites.  

@. Re-run all of our previous criticisms of Kate Davies and her predeliction for affordable rent and privatisation. Include also Steve Hilditch's recent [article](https://redbrickblog.wordpress.com/2017/01/07/one-article-does-not-wipe-the-slate-clean/) criticising Davies and Notting Hill (Hilditch is a former NHHT board member).

>"Social housing is not a desirable destination.. Private ownership is preferable to state-provided solutions". (Kate Davies, CEO of NHHT - 2008)

![CSJ report recommendations (co-authored by Kate Davies)](http://35percent.org/img/csjquoterents.png)  

## Bashing NHHT 
@. Submit the  on NHHT's rent hikes and evictions at its St. James estate in Bermondsey. Include MP Neil Coyle's criticisms and Cllr Pollak's quote saying NHHT is acting like a 'predatory landlord'. 

![[Southwark News article, 6/10/16](https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/housing-association-slammed-nightmare-scenario-eviction-threat-bermondseys-st-james-estate/)](http://35percent.org/img/nhhtevictions.png)  

@. Highlight NHHT's profit margin in the DPA.

@. Show how Wood Dene estate and Decathlon sites appear to have stalled. Point out affordable scandal at the Decathlon site (blog post to be drafted still) and the low level of social rented housing at the Wood Dene site. Make the point that NHHT successfully argued (using viability assessments) that it wasn't viable to provide more than the pitiful 15% (avg) social rented housing across both sites. So how can it be possible that the FDS site can viably provide over 40% social rented?

@. Include evidence on the Silwood estate and the 3 missing social rented housing units that NHHT should have delivered according to the planning consent and S106 agreement.

@. Show HCA/GLA stats showing how many thousands of homes NHHT has converted to affordable rent. 

## DPA provisions breached
@. NHHT has breached various provisions in the DPA including its obligation to purchase 5 street properties that it was to offer on shared equity terms to leaseholders in phase 1b/1c. The Council claims in its response to our Cabinet question that NHHT has indeed provided 2 such properties to leaseholders on the FDS. We should seek more details of this and ask why these were not offered to Beverley and Agnes.

@. The following changes to the funding programme show how NHHT is rolling back on its funding commitments to the scheme. In September 2016, Southwark [agreed](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s63817/Report.Aylesbury%20Regeneration%20Delivery.pdf) a number of changes to the development agreement with NHHT. Southwark agreed to forward fund £21m of the ongoing costs of progressing the scheme, that NHHT was originally required to fund under the terms of the Development Partnership Agreement. These comprised:

> * £16.8m demolition costs for the First Development Site
> * £0.8m for the demolition of Plot 18
> * £2m to underwrite the cost of Plot 18’s planning application
> * £2m to underwrite the design fees for phase 2

@. These costs are in addition to the Council’s other costs that it has already agreed to allocate to the scheme. In total the Council is now forecast to spend £52.5m over the next three years on the Aylesbury redevelopment scheme.

@. Notting Hill Housing’s commitment to the scheme is also plainly a concern. The [Cabinet report](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s63817/Report.Aylesbury%20Regeneration%20Delivery.pdf) goes on to say that _‘if the scheme has not proceeded in accordance with the DPA (Development Partnership Agreement)’_ then _‘at that point all design work will pass to the council enabling the council to market the site’_(para. 13) - in plain language: if Notting Hill drops out then Southwark takes over and looks for another developer. 

@. NHHT is also now [reducing](http://www.aylesburynow.london/news/posts/extra-affordable-homes-for-aylesbury-regeneration) the number of affordable units in plot 18, its first phase of development to be completed on the estate. It is moving these to be delivered instead on the FDS. Note that the [9 May Cabinet report](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s68298/Report%20Aylesbury%20Regeneration%20Programme%20Delivery.pdf) announced a change of phasing: the FDS has been swapped with plot 18 - i.e. the FDS will instead be the second phase of development completed by NHHT after plot 18. Fresh planning applications for both sites are expected shortly.

@. The Objectors submit that the number of social housing units on plot 18 has been reduced as a result of viability issues. The Objectors submit that this will be the fate of the FDS.

## The scheme will not be delivered in a reasonable time period 
@. Circular ODPM/2005 says that there needs to be evidence that the scheme underlying the Order will be completed in a 'reasonable' time period; we need to look up case identifying how 'reasonable time period' is to be interpreted.

@. Show how [Wood Dene estate](http://35percent.org/wood-dene-estate-regeneration/) was demolished in 2007 and how NHHT has [left the site empty](https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/notting-hill-admits-wood-dene-estate-peckham-wont-rebuilt-2019-thirteen-years-demolition/) for 10 years without building any new homes. This will be the future of phase 1b/1c.  

![](http://35percent.org/img/nhhtwooddeneadmission.png)  

@. The DPA says that the FDS will be completed by 2021, but NHHT have now put this back to 2024. See [here](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s68300/Appendix%202%20Draft%20development%20agreement.pdf).

## Refurb/Alternative to scheme underlying the CPO 

Work out how much AA receives in rental income from tenants on the estate. Say it should use this on refurb/maintenance instead of £100k salaries for PR managers (Tony Mainwairing). 

![](http://35percent.org/img/wendcomp.jpg)  

@. [This report](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s56449/Report%20Major%20works%20status%20report%20incorporating%20Warm%20Dry%20and%20Safe.pdf) describes different funding for DHS works, including the 'GLA Backlog fund' and the [accompanying appendices](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s56450/Appendices%201%20-%204%20Major%20works%20status%20report%20incorporating%20Warm%20Dry%20and%20Safe.pdf) show that the Four Squares estate (a High Investment Needs estate) was brought up to DHS for just £12m. Work out how much this is per unit and also show similar comparables.

@. On the question of sources of funding a refurb scheme, one could also include the Section 106 off-site pooled funding and that set aside for new Council homes. Refurbishment would also help the Council save on the [£10m per year it is having to spend on temporary accommodation](https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/council-spend-temporary-housing-now-five-times-20112012/):

![](http://35percent.org/img/spendbandb.png)  

@. [This Cabinet item](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieIssueDetails.aspx?IId=11030&Opt=3) from 2011 gives details of 'High Investment Needs estates' and gives cost estimates of DHS works. 

@. Appendix 6 of the Cabinet item shows the Aylesbury as not being the most costly of the estates. We could find out the actual costs of other estates on the list and do a comparison. Here's the [link to appendix 6](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s19628/Appendix%206%20List%20of%2015%20High%20Investment%20Needs%20Estates.pdf)

@. Southwark has in any case already [committed £12.5m to Major Works](http://35percent.org/img/Aylesbury-Phase-2-newsletter-February-2017-JH.pdf) bringing homes on phase 3/4 of the estate up to Decent Homes Standard.

## PSED
@. The only Equalities Assessment conducted on the scheme to date (the [2009 EqIA which accommpanied the AAAP](http://35percent.org/img/EqualitiesImpactAssessment.pdf)), relied upon the mitigation measures in place at the time for leaseholders- i.e. the rehousing options enshrined in the Council's [2006 rehousing policy](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/1850/executive_report) which included the like-for-like 'propery swap' for leaseholders. The 2006 policy and the Council's [Handbook for leaseholders](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/331856/response/818864/attach/3/64145%20RedR%20Homeowner.pdf) clearly state the 'property swap' as one of the available rehousing options:

![Extract from the [Leaseholders Handbook](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/331856/response/818864/attach/3/64145%20RedR%20Homeowner.pdf)](http://35percent.org/img/aylesburyleaseholdershandbookoptions.png)

@. The handbook gives a detailed description of the property swap policy available to leaseholders:

![Extract from the [Leaseholders Handbook](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/331856/response/818864/attach/3/64145%20RedR%20Homeowner.pdf)](http://35percent.org/img/aylesburyhandbookswap.png)

@. The EqIA specifically references the 2006 rehousing policy for leaseholders which it says offers leaseholders the _'widest possible choice of rehousing opportunities'_:

![](http://35percent.org/img/spiritofcooperation.png)  

![](http://35percent.org/img/widestpossiblechoice.png)  

@. Given that the 'property swap' option was subsequently withdrawn in 2010, it can be argued that the scheme doesn't comply with the PSED because one of the mitigation measures set out in the EqIA which underlies the AAAP has been withdrawn. Indeed it was the only mitigation measure that would have enabled leaseholders to remain 100% homeowners in the borough - i.e. not impoverished by the shared ownership options. 

@. Inspector Coffey said that leaseholders are left with two bleak options: moving out of the area or remaining but being impoverished. Like-for-like swap was the only option that would have enabled leaseholders to remain in the area without being impoverished. *We will need to show that the shared equity deal impoverishes leaseholders despite change in the £16k policy. (Investigate service charges etc)*

### Displacement
@. How many rehoused on estate footprint as per EqIA and AAAP intention?

@. Why have only 10 of the estate's 200 leaseholders decanted to date taken up the shared equity offer? Where did the rest of the leaseholders go?

## Compensation issues
@. The Council acknowledges that the value of homes on the Aylesbury are lower than any other properties in the borough and that their shared ownership options are a recognition of this.

@. The [minutes of 10/03/2014 Overview and Scrutiny Committee](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/mgAi.aspx?ID=32015) confirm that the Council's principal surveyor said _"The council’s ownership schemes were in recognition of the fact that the price offered might not enable a leaseholder to buy another property."_

@. In his [report](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s44932/Officer%20Report%20-%20Comparison%20of%20Discretionary%20Assistance%20Given%20to%20Resident%20Leaseholders.pdf) to that Committee, the Principal Surveyor said _"Some  Councils  offer  equivalent  exchange  whereby  a  leaseholder  swops his/her property for another of the same value.  This has been considered but the properties being regenerated in this Borough tend to be at the lowest level of the value scale. There are unlikely to be similar equivalents that aren’t part of regeneration schemes so such an offer would be hollow. "_  

## Rehousing options
@. In his [evidence](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/Mark_Maginn.pdf) to the site 7 CPO inquiry, Mark Maginn explains that leaseholders are assessed for rehousing on a 'cascade' basis; i.e. they are assessed to see if they can afford shared ownership before being considered for shared equity or other rehousing options. Given that shared ownership is much less attractive and more costly than shared equity, it is no surprise that only 10 of the over 200 leaseholders decanted have qualified for and taken up shared equity.

@. Request stock condition survey mentioned here: Paragraph  25  details  the  stock  condition  survey  undertaken  in  2010  which  has provided  the  most  robust  and  extensive  information  to date  on  the  state  of  the Council's  housing  stock. http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s19609/Report%20Housing%20investment%20programme%20and%20revised%20strategy.pdf

Request details of rehousing:
How many leaseholders rehoused as tenants? where? RSL etc?
How many shared ownership/equity etc.
Where did they go?
