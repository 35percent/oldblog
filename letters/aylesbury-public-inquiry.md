Viability assessment for phase 1b/1c - find out when due and make an FOI request.

Chase the ICO for the full unredacted DPA.

## Deliverability
Show how Wood Dene estate was demolished in 2007 and how NHHT has [left the site empty](https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/notting-hill-admits-wood-dene-estate-peckham-wont-rebuilt-2019-thirteen-years-demolition/) for 10 years without building any new homes. This will be the future of phase 1b/1c. Manor Place depot was granted planning permission in 2015 but construction has still not started.

## Tenure switch
Submit copy of Southwark's evidence from previous Inquiry where they claim to have robust S106 monitoring procedures.
Submit copy of Ombudsman decision and Sunday Times article showing Southwark's failure to monitor S106 AH tenure delivery because it doesn't have any monitoring procedures.
NHHT's other developments where social rent intended but affordable rent delivered - i.e. the one in Streatham delivered on an LB Lambeth estate.
Show how the breach at Bermondsey Spa hasn't been resolved, i.e. the Council hasn't taken effective action to recover the SR homes.  

Re-run all of our previous criticisms of Kate Davies and her predeliction for affordable rent and privatisation.

## Environmental disbenefits
Given Inspector Colley's comments on the environmental disbenefits and the fact that these were not explored in detail during the previous Inquiry, we should take the opportunity to explore them this time. We should cover a section on sunlight/daylight issues and also loss of public accessible open space.
