Dear Mayor,

We are a campaign group which was set up in response to Southwark Council's persistent failure to secure the 35% affordable housing required by its local planning policy.

Within the course of our campaigning activities, we have gained a thorough understanding of viability and have given evidence at examinations in public, public inquiries and Tribunal hearings into the disclosure of viability information.

Whilst we welcome the Mayor's new draft and affordable housing SPG, we have some serious reservations about the wording. These are laid out as follows:

## The Mayor and Referrable Applications

>"the Mayor __will consider__ directing that he is to be the Local Planning 
Authority for the purposes of determining an application (often referred to as a ‘call in’) or directing refusal when:
•    he is not satisfied with the viability information submitted by the applicant, the assumptions that underpin the information, or the level of scrutiny given by the LPA..." (para 1.16)

We are concerned about the level of discretion enabled by the wording of this paragraph. As we have seen with some major developments in Southwark, local authorities don't have the capacity, resources or expertise to sufficiently scrutinise viability and scrutiny can be compromised by political influence and objectives.

We believe that ALL major planning applications which don't meet the 35% affordable housing requirement should be called in for scrutiny by the Mayor.

## Transparency of Information
>"The Mayor wants the GLA to lead the way in openness and transparency.  In particular he considers that information relevant to planning determinations should be publicly available alongside the other application documents in order to foster a greater understanding of and trust in the planning system." (para. 1.17)

We believe that this wording should be amended to ensure that ALL viability information submitted is made publicly available AT THE SAME time as other application documents. This will avoid the problem we have here in Southwark where viability assessments are only made public a week before the planning committee hearing. This is clearly insufficient time for members of the public to digest such information.

Furthermore, paragraphs 1.21 and 1.22 effectively provide a welcome get-out clause for developers enabling them to keep information confidential in 'exceptional circumstances'. We have seen in Southwark how 'exceptional circumstances' can quickly become integrated into routine practice.

Paragraphs 1.21 and 1.22 should be removed in their entirety to avoid providing a loophole which will undoubtedly be exploited.

## CIL - priorities
Pargraphs 2.12 and 2.13 provide another convenient get-out clause for developers, allowing them to argue that the CIL contributions for a given site render affordable housing requirements unviable. The wording of the paragraphs will effectively enable contributions to the Mayor's transport projects to trump affordable housing requirements.

## Tenure
Paragraph 2.28 says that _"the Mayor is keen to maintain flexibility"_ in the tenure split requirements of the affordable housing quota. It goes on to require that 30% of the quota is provided as 'low cost rent' which can either be social rent or affordable rent; a futher 30% as intermediate; and the remainder to be decided on a borough level. 

We are very disappointed that the Mayor is continuing to conflate the tenure social rent with affordable rent. As our recent [report](http://35percent.org/2016-12-12-ombudsman-slams-southwark-for-no-s106-monitoring/) shows, this has led to cases where affordable rent is being delivered in place of social rent at up to 78% market rent - more than three times social rent levels. 

Given that a large number of Londoners can afford nothing but social rent, we fail to understand why the Mayor's new affordable SPG makes no requirement for social rented housing whatsoever.

Equally alarming is that the Mayor has allocated £3.15bn for 90,000 new affordable homes in the capital, but the [guidance](http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/journals/2016/11/28/g/d/y/GLA-Homes-For-London_v7.pdf) for the funding programme doesn't make any mention of funding for buiulding social rented homes.   

We are also concerned that the Mayor has exempted 'build-to-rent' developments from affordable housing requirements. (Jerry to expand on this)

## Affordable housing in perpetuity
As we have shown in our recent [report](http://35percent.org/2016-12-12-ombudsman-slams-southwark-for-no-s106-monitoring/) and Ombudsman investigation, Southwark has no procedures for monitoring whether developments were providing the level of affordable housing required by planning consents. 

Paragraphs 2.44 and 2.45 relating to securing affordable housing in perpetuity are meaningless unless they are accompanied by robust monitoring and enforcement procedures.

## Off-site and cash in lieu 
Paragraphs 2.48-2.53 enable the opportunity for developers to make an in-lieu payment or offsite provision instead of providing affordable housing on site. 

This goes against the whole concept of affordable housing policy in that its objective is to create mixed communities.

## Loss of existing affordable housing (including estate renewal)
This is a welcome section, but there remain ambiguities in the following wording:

>"The Mayor expects existing affordable housing to be replaced 
on a like-for-like basis, meaning there should be no net loss of existing affordable housing tenures (including social rented accommodation)." (para 2.54)

To avoid confusion which could be open to interpretation, we suggest that this should read _"there should be no net loss of social rented housing."_ 
  
## Developer Profit
>"Target profit levels should be appropriate to current market conditions and will reflect the level of risk being taken. They would currently be expected to be lower than levels that were typical following the financial downturn of 2008/9." (para 3.33)

We believe that a cap should be put on developer profit. In its [review](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/DVSreport_HeygateOutline.pdf) of the Heygate estate redevelopment, the District Valuer asserted that most schemes average out below 15% profit. We believe that this should be set as the upper limit of permissible developer's profit.

## Benchmark Land Value
Sections 3.36 to 3.49 set out the methodology for determining the benchmark land value used in viability testing. Whilst we support the assertion that Existing/Current Use Value should be used as the benchmark, we are concerned that there is not sufficient direction on how current use value should be calculated. 

We suggest that the capitalised rateable value of the current use of a given site should be used as the way to determine its current use value. The rateable value is a figure set and held by the local authority, which has been subject to scrutiny and is therefore reliable.
