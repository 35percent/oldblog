The development plan (i.e. AAAP, Local development framework, London Plan etc.) has been through a process of extensive consultation and its elements drawn up against the requirements of equalities and human rights duties. It has been produced at a high level and involved those
with considerable experience and expertise in the applicable area. Considerable research was
undertaken by skilled workers before the plan was finalised and each element was subject to a rigorous examination in public.

Those producing the elements of the development plan specifically recognised that other groups would be affected. For example, it was acknowledged that those with physical conditions could well suffer pain and discomfort from walking on tactile paving, but the risk to life and limb of the visually impaired was considered sufficient to justify the measures set out in the guidance. The development plan was furthermore issued against the background of the equality duty, by which the human rights and needs of protected groups - not just those on the order land, had to be given due regard.

[Extracts from AAAP, LDF and LP about diversity, PSED and BAME groups.]

The Acquiring Authority was required to follow the development plan. It has made numerous significant departes from the development plan without good reason: 

## Leaseholder rehousing
The 2009 AAAP EqIA specifically references the 2006 leaseholder rehousing policy. The 2006 rehousing policy is therefore part of the development plan. 

The reason given for the Acquiring Authority's Dec 2010 departure from the 2006 rehousing policy is given as 'unworkable and restricted'. (para 3.4)

## Forward funding of scheme costs
Paragraph 18 of the Cabinet report acknowledges that _"In bringing forward this funding from the HRA, the council recognises that there will be some knock-on impact on other housing investment projects."_ 

However, it fails to assess how this knock-on impact might affect protected groups.

## Departure from open space requirements
The Acquiring Authority claims that the failure to provide the required amount of open space is offset by the fact that the small amount provided will be of "better quality". There is no assessment of how this may impact on protected groups.

## Departure from play space requirements
The Acquiring Authority claims that the failure to provide the required amount of play space is offset by the fact that Burgess Park is nearby. It fails to address the AAAP requirement that there will be play space within 400m of each new home. There is no assessment of how this may impact on protected groups - i.e. young people's health and wellbeing.

## Departure from amenity space requirements
Ditto


## Conclusion
At none of the points of departure listed above did the Acquiring Authority undertake an assessment of its decision to depart, with regard to the PSED or human rights duties.

It is understood that approximately three months ago, the Acquiring Authority commenced a process of referencing, in order to assess the characteristics and needs of protected groups on the order land. THIS COMES SEVEN YEARS TOO LATE!!

Case law around the PSED makes it clear that the Acquiring Authority must start the equality analysis early in the process of policy development, at a formative stage so that the assessment is clearly seen as an integral part of the development and not as a later justification. The Acquiring Authority must able to evidence that equality considerations have been taken into account before a decision was made.

> "“Due regard” must be given “before and at the time that a particular policy that will
or might affect disabled people is being considered by the public authority in question”:
Brown at [91]. Due regard to the duty must be an “essential preliminary” to any
important policy decision, not a “rearguard action following a concluded decision”: R
(BAPIO Action Ltd) v SSHD [2007] EWCA Civ 1139 at [3]. Consideration of the duty
must be an “integral part of the formation of a proposed policy, not justification for its
adoption”: R (Kaur and others) v Ealing LBC [2008] EWHC 2062 (Admin) at [24].



## Council's equality policy
The Council's [Budget Equality Analysis](https://www.2.southwark.gov.uk/downloads/download/2950/budget_equality_analysis) for Housing says:

Southwark's [website](http://www.2.southwark.gov.uk/info/200527/equality_and_diversity/2490/publishing_of_equality_information) says: _"Community impact statements are provided in all reports to cabinet, individual cabinet members, scrutiny, regulatory committees and community councils. Community impact statements enable decision makers to identify how a decision might affect different communities in Southwark and to consider any implications for equality."_
