Southwark's [website](http://www.2.southwark.gov.uk/info/200527/equality_and_diversity/2490/publishing_of_equality_information) says: _"Community impact statements are provided in all reports to cabinet, individual cabinet members, scrutiny, regulatory committees and community councils. Community impact statements enable decision makers to identify how a decision might affect different communities in Southwark and to consider any implications for equality."_
