Here's the link to the CPO resolution for the Wood Dene (Aka the Acorn estate).

_"Securing vacant possession and onward sale to the RSL will generate a substantial capital sum. The securing of this receipt is essential to the delivery of the Housing Investment Programme."_

## Main thread
The development plan (i.e. AAAP, Local development framework, London Plan etc.) has been through a process of extensive consultation and its elements drawn up against the requirements of equalities and human rights duties. It has been produced at a high level and involved those
with considerable experience and expertise in the applicable area. Considerable research was
undertaken by skilled workers before the plan was finalised and the main elements have been subjected to a rigorous examination in public.

Those producing the development plan specifically recognised that other groups would be affected. __For example, it was acknowledged that those with physical conditions could well suffer pain and discomfort from walking on tactile paving, but the risk to life and limb of the visually impaired was considered sufficient to justify the measures set out in the guidance__. The development plan was issued against the background of the equality duty, by which the human rights and needs of protected groups - not just those on the order land, had to be given due regard.

The Acquiring Authority was required to follow the development plan. It has made numerous significant departes from the development plan without good reason: 


## Departure from like-for-like policy
Southwark's [website](http://www.2.southwark.gov.uk/info/200527/equality_and_diversity/2490/publishing_of_equality_information) says: _"Community impact statements are provided in all reports to cabinet, individual cabinet members, scrutiny, regulatory committees and community councils. Community impact statements enable decision makers to identify how a decision might affect different communities in Southwark and to consider any implications for equality."_

But at the time Council decided to depart from the like-for-like policy (14th Dec 2010 Cabinet - item 9), it gave no clear reason for the departure. In his evidence to the Site 7 CPO inquiry, he argued that it was withdrawn because it was 'unworkable and restrictive' (para 3.4). 

In terms of the community impact statement all that the Cabinet report said was: _"There are no particular groups which have been identified as being disadvantaged by the change in policy. The affordability assessment takes into consideration the age of the home owner such that if they are above state retirement age, no mortgage ability is assumed. Therefore, this decision has been judged to have no or a very small impact on local people and communities itself, outside of the wider decision to regenerate the area."_ (para 25)

## Departure from funding agreement
Paragraph 18 of the Cabinet report acknowledges that _"In bringing forward this funding from the HRA, the council recognises that there will be some knock-on impact on other housing investment projects."_ 

However, it fails to assess how this knock-on impact might affect protected groups.

## Departure from open space requirements
The Acquiring Authority claims that the failure to provide the required amount of open space is offset by the fact that the small amount provided will be of "better quality". There is no assessment of how this may impact on protected groups.

## Departure from play space requirements
The Acquiring Authority claims that the failure to provide the required amount of play space is offset by the fact that Burgess Park is nearby. It fails to address the AAAP requirement that there will be play space within 400m of each new home. There is no assessment of how this may impact on protected groups - i.e. young people's health and wellbeing.

## Departure from amenity space requirements
Ditto
 
Case law around the PSED makes it clear that the Acquiring Authority must start the equality analysis early in the process of policy development, at a formative stage so that the assessment is clearly seen as an integral part of the development and not as a later justification. The Acquiring Authority must able to evidence that equality considerations have been taken into account before a decision was made.

> "“Due regard” must be given “before and at the time that a particular policy that will or might affect disabled people is being considered by the public authority in question”: Brown at [91]. Due regard to the duty must be an “essential preliminary” to any important policy decision, not a “rearguard action following a concluded decision”: R (BAPIO Action Ltd) v SSHD [2007] EWCA Civ 1139 at [3]. Consideration of the duty must be an “integral part of the formation of a proposed policy, not justification for its adoption”: R (Kaur and others) v Ealing LBC [2008] EWHC 2062 (Admin) at [24].
