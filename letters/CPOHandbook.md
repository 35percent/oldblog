## Introduction
Who we are, how long we have been battling with Southwark Council

## What is a Compulsory Purchase Order
Gives Council the right to take possession of your homes.

## Get in beforehand
Frankly, if you have got to CPO stage it is probably too late. 
Get in early, lobby the Council for a fair deal before it gets anywhere near the start of the decant and CPO procedures.
The Council needs to produce a policy for how it is going to treat leaseholders in any redevelopment scheme and it needs to consult on this policy.
The problem we had was that we we didn't get organised until it was too late and the Council had co-opted the TRA's and set up the 'Creation Trust', which is supposedly the 'voice of residents'.

Make sure your interests are represented and make sure you secure a fair deal and make sure it is written into policy. Southwark Council's policy was to offer leaseholders new homes on a 'shared equity' basis, which it claims enables us to live 'rent free' for the rest of our lives in a new home on the estate. What it doesn't mention is the small print; intitially the small print in this deal came with small print preventing leaseholders from recouping any of the uplift on their share of the new home when the came to sell. i.e. you own half of the home but only receive your initial cash share when you come to sell. After much lobbying we finally got this changed such that leaseholders are now offered their share of the uplift, but what we want to see is the following:

Leaseholders' homes should be valued based on the average of three independent valuations by RICS registered valuers selected by the leaseholder.

The valuation should also include 10% uplift to reflect blight and account for the Council's ongoing failure to properly maintain the estate. (note 10% blight was previously agreed in one of the 2014 Aylesbury Tribunal cases)
 
Leaseholders should be made an offer of a new home on the estate and retain 100% equity and ownership of it. This can be achieved through a charge that the Council or its developer will put on the sum required to cover the difference between value of the old home and the value of the new home.

Should the leaseholder come to sell the property, the charge will be reimbursed together with interest (linked to the rate of inflation). This avoids the situation where the Council or developer benefit from capital uplift as a result of improvements made to the property by the leaseholder, and also avoids speculative gain (or loss) from housing market fluctuations.  
 
## How to resist a CPO
Get organised - get a list of other leaseholders on your estate. You can do this either from the freehold deeds available from the Land Registry. The Land Registry Freehold title certificate will contain a list of all of the leasehold properties that have exchanged hands since registration became mandatory in 2003. This won't capture the initial RtB purchases. You can also find out leasehold property from historic properties sold data available from Zoopla etc.

## Lands Tribunal
One of the common responses from Council officials to complaints about low valuations is that if leaseholders aren't happy then they can refer the issue to the Lands Tribunal to be determined independently.
The problem is that this whole process is inherently unfair. First of all, you can't refer the issue to the Lands Tribunal until the Council has already taken possession of your home. The process can be very slow and can take up to a year before the case is heard and decided. Then there is the possibility that the Council may appeal the decision if they are not happy with it. 
The second issue is costs. You are effectively litigating against the Council and litigation requires not just a solicitor, but also a barrister and your surveyor. You should expect to pay at least Â£15-20,000 for proper professional representation.
It is likely your case will be heard under what is known as the 'simplified procedure', where each party is normally expected to bear their own costs. There is a caveat however, which is that during the procedure the Council is entitled to make a 'sealed envelope' offer to you to settle the case at any time before the day of the hearing. If the Council makes such an offer and you refuse it then when it comes to the Tribunal determining the final value of your home, if the Tribunal's figure is less than the Council's sealed offer then the Council can force you to pay all of their legal costs.
