Complaint ref:__16 005 626__

Dear Mr Warren,

Thank you for your email dated 14th Nov with the Ombudsman's draft decision and 
invitation to comment on the draft notice.

Firstly, we have comments to make on the wording of the following paragraphs of 
the draft decision notice:

## Paragraph 10
>"Social rented housing and affordable housing now have specific meanings. 
For my purposes I shall use the term social housing units."

According to sections 68 and 69 of the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008, 
'social housing' encompasses both social rented and affordable rented housing.  
In order to avoid confusion we suggest that the term 'social rented housing' is 
used throughout the decision notice.

## Paragraph 11
>"Mr X says that by failing to supervise compliance some developers have failed 
>to provide the right number of social housing units."

Having provided the Ombudsman investigation with evidence that developers 
__have indeed failed__ to provide the right number of social rented housing 
units and given that the Council has acknowledged this, we request that this 
paragraph be updated to reflect this. We suggest the following revised wording: 

>_"Mr X provided evidence indicating that by failing to supervise compliance 
some developers have failed to provide the right number of social rented 
housing units."_.

## Paragraph 12
>"In response to my enquiries the Council accepts it did not have a systematic 
>supervision procedure to check compliance.

This fails to reflect the Council's admission in its (3/11/2016) response to 
question 5 of the Ombudsman's investigation that a 'small number' of the 43 
instances we submitted, _"have resulted in under-provision and are currently 
progressing these through legal channels, including trial at the High Court."_
 
We suggest the following revised wording:
>_"In response to my enquiries the Council has said that it is taking 
enforcement in response to several of the breaches identified by Mr X and that 
it did not have a systematic supervision procedure to check compliance._"

## Monitoring procedures
We feel that the proposed procedure outlined in paragraph 16 of asking developers to confirm that they have complied, is inadequate. We feel that the procedure should be that checks are conducted by an independent authority - one that can demonstrate that it has no ‘skin in the game’, either with the Council or the developers involved. We see no reason why the monitoring procedures shouldn't additionaly include a cross-check with the government's CORE lettings data system.   

## Effective enforcement action
Paragraph 14: the Ombudsman has made the point in para 6 that enforcement powers are discretionary. Our point is that severe harm is always caused by the failure to deliver social housing; (there is a 20,000 housing waiting list in Southwark). So the presumptions should be that the discovery of any failure to deliver on S106 agreements should result in enforcement action.

In this respect we feel that the investigation has failed to address a major aspect 
of our complaint; namely that the Council has failed to take effective 
enforcement action to remedy the situtation in at least one instance where we 
discovered that social rented housing has failed to be provided.

Our complaint specifically referred to a development of 205 homes at the 
Bermondsey Spa regeneration (ref:10/AP/3010), where 44 social rented homes 
required by planning consent were not provided.

The Council argued that the situation was resolved by the agreement that the 44 
units are going to be provided by the RSL concerned at a development elsewhere 
(Manor Place Depot 15/AP/1062). We complained that this remedy is ineffective 
because these 44 units are being used to fulfil the affordable housing quota 
for that development and therefore cannot be used to offset the shortfall.


It would appear that this part of our complaint has not been addressed by the 
investigation or the Ombudsman's decision notice. We request that it is 
considered and included in the decision notice. 

I look forward to hearing from you and please do not hesitate should you 
require further details regarding any of the above.

Yours sincerely,
