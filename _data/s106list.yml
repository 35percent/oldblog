  comment: No nomination rights, no perpetuity clause and the MiP clause (pages 26 and 27) fails to provide a bail-out clause.

  comment: There is a perpetuity clause on page 43 (para 1.2.9) but it says 'subject to clause 8' - what is clause 8? should this say schedule 8? The MiP provisions don't include a bail-out clause.
