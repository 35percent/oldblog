  comment: "My name is Nassim Cheraitian, I’ve been trading at Elephant and Castle market for over 20 years. The closing down of the Shopping Centre, for us,
wasn’t good news, because they haven’t helped us.

For the last three, four, five years business has been down, we’ve been losing, losing... they promised us they would help to find us to find a new unit but they didn’t. I applied, they asked us for all our details [...] we provided them with everything. After that they said that there isn’t space for everyone. And it’s been left like this.

We don’t have anywhere to go. They [the council] gave us £3000, but honestly it’s not really [been helpful]. £3000 is nothing — three years ago they told us they would help us, so all that time we’ve been waiting, the business has gone down, we’ve been losing money, losing customers every day, and we were waiting to get something back. Instead we got £3000. I don’t have any plans, as I’ve been waiting to get this promised help from the council [...] we’ve been here for too long for them to leave us like this [...] [my  customers] are unhappy, they think it is unfair to us, we’ve been here too long to be left with nothing—no shop, no unit, nothing."

  comment: "My name is Shapoor Amini, I’ve worked at this market since 2001. These people promised us so many things, they said we’ll give you a space, we’ll look after you guys, but they’ve done nothing for us.

Some people who were [trading] here for one year, two years, 6 months, they got a space. Me, I’ve been here 20 years, and they gave me nothing; they just said sorry, sorry, you still need to wait. And I don’t know what’s going on. I had someone who worked for me who got a space! But I’ve been here for twenty years and nothing. I applied so many times—I’ve made calls, been to the council, been to the office, done lots of paperwork [...] been to countless meetings, and still nothing. I don’t know why not, they never talk to us face to face. They sent letters out [...]some people got something, others didn’t [...] everybody knows me here [...] customers come to me as say ‘where is your new space?’, and I say I don’t know. My whole life has been spent in this market, in this area, and now I don’t know what to do. It’s very difficult for me. I have a kids, a wife... they said if you find yourself a shop we will help you. But at this late stage how can I find a shop? [...] they promised us too much. Places are asking for a £30,000 deposit, it is very difficult."
