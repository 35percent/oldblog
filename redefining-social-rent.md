Southwark Council has [fought vehemently](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/news/article/1617/southwark_council_challenges_mayor_over_affordable_rent) against the Tory-led introduction of __affordable rent__, i.e. rents of up to 80% market rent.

Southwark has consistently opposed the provision of affordable rent on the basis that it is not affordable for the majority of the borough’s residents and its [planning policy](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/12867/new_southwark_plan_preferred_option_consultation_version_web) is unambiguous in its requirement for social rather than affordable rent:

However, the vast majority of replacement social rented homes on the Heygate were substituted for affordable rent and in March 2015 we [discovered](http://35percent.org/2015-03-18-stand-up-for-more-social-housing/) that 44 social rented units that were supposed to have replaced 54 council homes demolished at the Bermondsey Spa regeneration, had in fact been provided as affordable rent of 62% market rent - in breach of the planning approval. We then discovered that Notting Hill Housing Association had pulled the same tenure switch with its regeneration of the Silwood estate in Bermondsey and that housing associations across the borough were routinely breaching planning approvals by substituting social for affordable rent.

By cross-checking planning committee reports, section 106 agreements, Land Registry information and the [GLA affordable housing outturn dataset](http://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/gla-affordable-housing-programme-outturn/resource/0c87e5dc-f1e9-4edf-b246-bef6b40a9ba3), we have compiled a [long list](http://35percent.org/img/section106_tenure_breaches.pdf) of identified breaches in tenure provision. This causes great concern that the Council is opposed to affordable rent only in appearance - not in practice. We believe that the Council's admininstration is turning a blind eye to this practice, which helps it make claims to delivering social rented housing in the borough, which is in fact nothing of the kind.

The [list](http://35percent.org/img/section106_tenure_breaches.pdf) is by no means exhaustive and we are calling for a full audit in order to establish the full scale, of the problem. We submitted it to the Council as part of our corporate complaint in December 2015 and are yet to receive a substantive response.

Until such time as there has been a borough-wide s106 audit, enforcement action taken and procedures put in place for ongoing monitoring of compliance, then the Council’s use of the term __social rent__ must be assumed to mean __affordable rent__.
 
The following are a few examples of the 43 breaches identified in our [list](http://35percent.org/img/section106_tenure_breaches.pdf). In most cases the rents are currently lower than 80% market rent, but still significantly higher than the [average £100pw council rents](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/news/article/1738/southwark_council_keeping_social_rent_affordable_for_londoners). In 2015, Southwark conducted an [Affordable Rent Study](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/downloads/download/2914/affordable_rent_in_southwark_2011), which concluded that _"as market rents are very high in Southwark, significant incomes are required to afford high proportions of market rent, but average incomes of people living in Southwark are low."_ The study [showed](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/13082/affordable_rent_study_-_december_2015) that a single person on the average median income for Southwark cannot afford more than 26% market rent and that a lone parent working on average income cannot afford more than 14% market rent. These figures are a lot lower than the 35%/40% and 50% of market rent routinely quoted by Councillors, council officers and developers as social rents or their equivalents.

The same [affordable rent study](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/downloads/download/2914/affordable_rent_in_southwark_2011) shows that social rent in Southwark reflects these very low incomes; a simple calculation tells us that a social rent in Southwark for a 1-bed flat is £96.88 on average (incl. service charge) - this is 25.5% of market rent; a 2-bed social rented flat is £110.76 per week on average (24.2% market rent); a 3-bed is £124.18 pw (22.5% market rent); a 4-bed is £139.69 (19.3% market rent).

## Colorama buildings
This redevelopment of the former [Colorama film processing warehouse](http://35percent.org/colorama/) in SE1 was completed in April 2016. The [planning report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!Zz6kQSuw9WcG1eGU1VRSAg%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) for the application said that the redevelopment would provide a total of 19 social rented habitable rooms.

However, when the Greater London Authority published its [affordable housing outturn data](http://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/gla-affordable-housing-programme-outturn/resource/0c87e5dc-f1e9-4edf-b246-bef6b40a9ba3), it showed that the developer had provided affordable rented units not social rented. These range up to 59% market rent and are listed in the GLA dataset as prospective rent levels of £215pw (excl. service charge) for a 1-bed flat, which is well over twice the current average social rent in Southwark ([£100 pw](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/news/article/1738/southwark_council_keeping_social_rent_affordable_for_londoners)).

The scheme (now branded the ['Chroma Buildings'](http://www.fabrica.co.uk/The-Chroma-Buildings)) has completed and new residents moved in. Needless to say, these won't number any of those on the Council's waiting list who are desperately in need of social rented housing.

## 177-184 Grange Road, Bermondsey
The [planning committee report](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s21421/Item%201%20report.pdf) (11/AP/1390) for this development approved 38 new homes, of which 9 were supposed to be social rented units. The GLA data shows that these have been delivered by Leicester Housing Association as affordable rents of up to 52% market rent.

## 430 Old Kent Road SE1 5AG - (Family Mosaic development)
This is one of the [Neo-Bankside](/neo-bankside) off-site affordable housing sites, which according to Southwark's [planning committee report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!siQ3eaBQc4N16%2bb1RFDnxQ%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) (11/AP/0138) approved 22 social rented units, but the GLA dataset shows that these have been delivered by Family Mosaic at affordable rents of up to 49% market rent.

## 143-149 Rye Lane/1-15 Bournemouth Road Peckham - SE15 4ST 
Southwark's [planning committee report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!yP1lK1SBYnvpeezqHiCudA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) (06/AP/0995) approved 61 new homes of which 7 should have been social rented units, but the GLA dataset shows that these have been delivered by London & Quadrant as affordable rents of between 74% and 78% market rent.

## Crown St Depot
Southwark's [planning committee report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!Pdhuk%2f2yE0RCmdPqLV1odQ%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) promised that 7 of these 69 new homes would be social rented, but the GLA affordable housing outturn data shows these as being provided by Leicester Housing Association at affordable rents of 40% market rent. Paragraph 74 of the planning committee report also asserted that the developer would refurbish and extend the neighbouring council-owned Bethwyn Road Playgroup Centre. However, these refurbishment and extension works have not been undertaken.

## Rolls Rd/Coopers Rd - (Peabody development)
This is the fourth and final phase of the [Coopers Road estate regeneration](/coopers-road-estate), which saw a block of 12 family maisonettes demolished. The [planning committee report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!LxiP99PHNyQALLSNryD5lQ%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) (12/AP/3201) confirms that of the 47 new homes in this development, 9 should be social rent and 2 let at affordable rent. The GLA data shows that the 9 ‘social rented’ units are being let by Peabody as affordable rent at 37% market rent.

## 20-30 Wilds Rents (Sadlers Yard) SE1 
The [planning committee report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!sMV%2bUJBoAL91ysCbGKu2Ww%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) (11/AP/0217) confirms that six of the 37 new residential units in this development were to be social rent (5 x 3-beds, 1 x 2-bed). However, the section 106 agreement defines social rent using the affordable rent definition and the GLA data shows these as having been provided at levels of up to 40% market rent.

## 126 Spa road - Bermondsey Spa regeneration (Hyde Housing development)
The [planning committee report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!z6IxAI8v8vQ0Jgh0sn1SbQ%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) (12/AP/0164) approves 46 units of which 38 private, 7 social rent and 1 affordable rent capped at 65% market rent. However, in the section 106 agreement for this application, the social rented units are described as ‘affordable rent’ and the GLA shows all units as affordable rents of between 27% and 58% market rent. In Jan 2016, Hyde [advertised](http://web.archive.org/web/20160112154349/https://www.sharetobuy.com/sharedownershippropertydetails?id=21879) a 3-bed ‘affordable’ unit in this development for rent at £1,849 per month.

The [planning committee report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b%21NSTsGbiMYYs7hVWdLHOlOA%3d%3d%21%7d%7d%7d) (14/AP/2102) for this Linden Homes development (on former [council-owned land](/bermondsey-spa-regeneration) confirms that this site was to provide 167 residential units, of which 34 were to be social rent. The GLA dataset lists this scheme (under Leicester Housing association) with rents at affordable rents of 52% market rent.

## BERMONDSEY SPA SITE C5 (10/AP/3010)
This application was made by Notting Hill Housing Trust, for the redevelopment of 54 council homes as part of the Bermondsey Spa regeneration and was approved by planning committee On 21st December 2010. Permission allowed for the demolition of a number of Council homes and construction of 205 new homes, some commercial and community premises and associated works. 
Our [2015 blog post](http://www.the-exchange-london.com/web/images/01/gallery/exterior/camera-2.jpg) covers the development in more detail, showing how the 44 social rented homes were provide at affordable rents of up to 62% market rent.
This is the one scheme that the Council has responded to in our complaint. It considers the matter resolved, partly through having secured a number of social rented units from Notting Hill Housing Trust at its [Manor Place depot development](http://35percent.org/manor-place-depot/). However, these units were required to meet the affordable housing quota for that site and therefore cannot be used to offset the shortfall at the Bermondsey Spa redevelopment (there remains a net loss of social rented housing across the two sites).

## Silwood estate regeneration Site 4B (11/AP/0139)
Notting Hill Housing was supposed to provide 22 social rented homes as part of its [redevelopment of the Silwood estate](/silwood-estate-regeneration) involving the demolition of 57 council homes and construction of 127 new homes. The the definition of social rented in the section 106 agreement is worded as affordable rent and these are showing up in the GLA data as having been provided as affordable rent. The GLA data only provides indicative rent levels and the levels given in 2013 as part of its funding bid are not too far off social rents, but we don't know what the actual rent levels charged are. Both the Council and Notting Hill have refused to our repeated requests for a schedule of acutal rents for the 22 'social rented' units.

## Aylesbury estate
Given Notting Hill's track record for tenure substitutions and Southwark's complicity, we are under no illusion as to what kind of 'social rented' housing Notting Hill will provide in its redevelopment of the Aylesbury. We have documented on [this page](/aylesbury-estate) how Notting Hill's GLA funding agreement for the Aylesbury, ties it in any case to the provision of affordable rent rather than social rent.
