Southwark Council has [fought vehemently](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/news/article/1617/southwark_council_challenges_mayor_over_affordable_rent) against the Tory-led introduction of __affordable rent__, i.e. rents of up to 80% market rent.

Southwark has consistently opposed the provision of affordable rent on the basis that it is not affordable for the majority of the borough’s residents and its [planning policy](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/12867/new_southwark_plan_preferred_option_consultation_version_web) is unambiguous in its requirement for social rather than affordable rent:

However, in March 2015 - exchange 44 units at affordable rent.. 

the following list of identified breaches in tenure provision causes concern that the Council is opposed to affordable rent only in appearance - not in practice. The list is by no means exhaustive and we are calling for a full audit in order to establish the full scale, of what we believe to be a systemic monitoring and compliance failure on behalf of the local planning authority.

Until such time as there has been a borough-wide s106 audit, enforcement action taken and procedures put in place for ongoing monitoring of compliance, then the Council’s commitment to social rented housing remains in question.
 

## Colorama buildings
This redevelopment of the former [Colorama film processing warehouse](http://35percent.org/colorama/) in SE1 was completed in April 2016. 

The [planning report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!Zz6kQSuw9WcG1eGU1VRSAg%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) for the application said that the redevelopment would provide a total of 19 social rented habitable rooms.

However, two years later when the Greater London Authority published its [affordable housing outturn data](http://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/gla-affordable-housing-programme-outturn/resource/0c87e5dc-f1e9-4edf-b246-bef6b40a9ba3), it showed that the developer had provided affordable rented units not social rented. These range up to 59% market rent and are listed in the GLA dataset as prospective rent levels of £215pw (excl. service charge) for a 1-bed flat, which is well over twice the current average social rent in Southwark ([£100 pw](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/news/article/1738/southwark_council_keeping_social_rent_affordable_for_londoners)).

The scheme (now branded the ['Chroma Buildings'](http://www.fabrica.co.uk/The-Chroma-Buildings)) has completed and new residents moved in. Needless to say, these won't number any of those on the Council's waiting list who are desperately in need of social rented housing.

The [planning committee report](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s21421/Item%201%20report.pdf) for this redevelopment of existing buildings providing 38 new homes, says that it was supposed to provide 9 social rented units. The GLA data shows that these have been delivered as affordable rent at up to 52% market rent.
