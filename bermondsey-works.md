CIL [exemption](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!9yfPr65e8LF7VyEMlMJXXA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) form says that the developer is Telford Homes (aka Higgins?) and HOusing association is Wandle.

[Officers Report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!8b5dKkAIXek9gcaSYz15mg%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) said application proposed 6 s/o and 4 social rented homes. But [s106](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!KaiWotaf%2bxHDP83nK8Z9gw%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) says just 10 s/o homes?..

This is explained in the [GLA report](/img/southwarkfreeschoolGLAreport.pdf) which says, despite Southwark's insistence that the development could provide more affordable housing, that the viability of the scheme means that only 10 S/O homes can be viably provided. 
It also says that the low affordable housing provision (5.9%) is justified because the development is cross-subsidising the free school.

The officers report also says that Council didn't agree the assumptions in the viability assessment..

[Section 106 agreement](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!KaiWotaf%2bxHDP83nK8Z9gw%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) says that the total contribution made towards new local transport infrastructure is £88,546.

Architect and planning agent is Rolfe Judd - also involved in Malt St development opposite (Berkeley) and Dashwood Studios Scheme (planning appeal) on Walworth rd.

Viability assessment prepared by ['Affordalbehousingsolutions.com'](http://www.ah-solutions.com/)

MP Simon Hughes [investigated](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/lib-dem-deputy-investigated-over-lobbying-8395968.html) for receiving donations from the developers and owners of the site 'Southwark Metals'.

>Mr Hughes had attempted to arrange meetings with fellow MPs and councillors to discuss the "Rotherhithe New Road regeneration project", put forward by SCCD Developments – which owns Southwark Metals.

In January 2017, it was [announced](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/jan/15/southwark-free-school-london-to-close-60-pupils) that the free school would not open because of a lack of pupils.

No viability review mechanism in the S106 agreement so what now?
