This is what the Green Dale playing fields in East Dulwich used to look like:

In the early 90s the club owners came to Southwark Council pleading poverty and claiming that the 100 year-old club was unviable and wouldn't be able to survive unless it was given planning to sell some of its ground for redevelopment.  

The Council reluctantly granted planning permission for a Sainsbury's superstore and car park along with consent for a new clubhouse with a health and fitness club, including gym and squash courts.

Now the club's owners (a property developer based on the Isle of Man) have come back to the Council once again pleading viability poverty. In its covering letter](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!MOs846oklOp6ieOeJtYFyA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) to the planning application, the club's owner claims _"The current stadium was constructed in the early 1990s to include a full-sized football pitch plus 5-a-side pitches, main stand, clubhouse and health and fitness club, including gym and squash courts. This previous redevelopment of the club was intended to provide a strong and financially sustainable base for DHFC, but in reality the Club has been unable to support the level of ancillary facilities currently provided on site. The gym, squash courts and entertainment space have been consistent loss makers that have resulted in a wholly financially insecure future for DHFC."_

It goes on to explain that these new  "_proposals will also deliver 155 residential units, which will facilitate the stadiumâ€™s relocation and redevelopment whilst delivering a vibrant community of affordable and private homes, contributing towards the delivery of much needed housing in the Dulwich area."_

It claims that the residential development along with proposals for a new stadium _"will remove financial burdens for the club"_ which _"will ensure a long term sustainable future for DHFC, protecting its historical significance."_

However, having sold off all its spare land to Sainsburys the club was faced with the small problem of having nowhere to build the 155 new homes. This is where Southwark has come to the rescue and offered to sell the club part of the adjacent Green Dale playing fields. The stadium can thus be relocated to where the Green Dale astro turf pitches are currently located and the new homes can be built on the site of the existing stadium.

Council leader Peter John has [said publicly](http://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/final-plans-new-dulwich-hamlet-stadium-submitted/) "I am opposed to the Hadley scheme", so why is he agreeing to sell it the necessary land?
