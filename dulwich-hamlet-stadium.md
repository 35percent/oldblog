Dulwich Hamlet FC is a much-loved Southwark football club with an impressive history. This is their Champion Hill ground adjacent to Green Dale playing fields where the club has been playing since 1931:

The club was doing well until the freehold owners of the grounds (King's College) sold the site to property developers and has since joined the long list of football clubs (particularly in London and not only at non-league level) falling victim to the ambitions of property developers. In the early 90s the site saw its first redevelopment supported by arguments that the 100 year-old club had become unviable and wouldn't survive unless it was given planning permission to sell some of its ground for redevelopment and build leisure facilities to provide extra revenue.  

The Council reluctantly granted permission for a Sainsbury's superstore and car park along with consent for a new clubhouse with a health and fitness club, including gym and squash courts. As part of the section 106 agreement it was agreed that Sainsbury's would pay for three half-size astro-turf pitches to be installed on the Council-owned Green Dale playing fields adjacent to the DHFC stadium.

Aware of the precarious position of being owned by a property developer, in September 2013, Dulwich Hamlet Supporters’ Trust announced that it had succeeded in having the stadium listed as an “Asset of Community Value” by Southwark Council. It was the first London football ground to be listed. However, shortly after a further new owner ([Hadley Group](http://hadleypropertygroup.com/)) purchased the site in 2014, Southwark Council removed the club's ACV status on a legal technicality involving the original application for listing. 

Hadley is owned by Hong Kong developer Peterson group,  which is [owned](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/04/07/wealthy-hong-kong-family-to-plough-200m-into-uk-real-estate/) by wealthy Hong Kong business tycoons the Yeung family and used an SPV [registered](http://35percent.org/img/LRegisterDHFC.pdf) on the Isle of Man to purchase the Champion Hill site. 

Hadley has now come back to the Council once again pleading viability poverty. In its [covering letter](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!MOs846oklOp6ieOeJtYFyA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) to the planning application, Hadley claims _"The current stadium was constructed in the early 1990s to include a full-sized football pitch plus 5-a-side pitches, main stand, clubhouse and health and fitness club, including gym and squash courts. This previous redevelopment of the club was intended to provide a strong and financially sustainable base for DHFC, but in reality the Club has been unable to support the level of ancillary facilities currently provided on site. The gym, squash courts and entertainment space have been consistent loss makers that have resulted in a wholly financially insecure future for DHFC."_

Hadley goes on to explain that these new proposals _"will also deliver 155 residential units, which will facilitate the stadium’s relocation and redevelopment whilst delivering a vibrant community of affordable and private homes, contributing towards the delivery of much needed housing in the Dulwich area."_

It claims that the proposed residential development along with new stadium _"will remove financial burdens for the club"_ which _"will ensure a long term sustainable future for DHFC, protecting its historical significance."_

However, having sold off all its spare land to Sainsburys, the club was faced with the small problem of having nowhere to build the 155 new homes. This is where Southwark has come to the rescue and offered to sell/give Hadley part of the adjacent Green Dale playing fields. The stadium can thus be relocated to where the Council's astro-turf pitches are located on Green Dale playing fields and the new homes can be built on the site of the existing stadium.

This has naturally met with [local opposition](http://www.friendsofdkhwood.org/2016/04/green-dale-planning-application/) as the astro-turf pitches on Green Dale are not only [council-owned](http://35percent.org/img/LRegisterGreenDale.pdf) publicly accessible open space, but enjoy [Metropolitan Open Land (MOL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Open_Land) protection. However, this doesn't necessarily stop the Council granting permission and it has [done so](http://35percent.org/sustainable-development/) on many occasions in the past. 
 
Notwithstanding the loss of council-owned public open space, the application is additionally questionable in that of the 155 new homes proposed, not one is offered as social rented. This is a clear breach of the Council's planning policy which requires 35% affordable housing, 70% of which social rented. This development would therefore normally be expected to provide 38 social rented homes for Southwark families who can't afford home ownership or market rents. Instead the application proposes just 16% affordable housing in a mix of shared ownership and 'affordable rent' - i.e. rents of up to 80% market rent[^1].

Hadley justifies its pitiful affordable housing offer by playing the usual viability trump card - i.e. the development is not profitable enough to provide the requisite 35% policy-compliant affordable housing mix as well as an acceptable level of profit for Hadley. Under normal circumstances this would be the end of the story; the developer's viability figures would remain confidential and the application would be waved through on the argument that 16% is the most that can viably be provided. However, as a result of the Council's new policy forcing viability assessments to be made public, we are able to examine the key assumptions in the [viability assessment summary](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!g6Huud%2ffC8539Zj%2bH4Z0qg%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) submitted by Hadley.

## First impressions
<img src="http://35percent.org/img/socialcleanserssavills.jpg" align="left" style="margin:10px" width="100">The first thing that strikes us is that Hadley's viability assessment was compiled by our old friends and global property giant Savills. Savills has a long chequered history in all things viability - it was behind [Lend Lease's viability assessment](http://35percent.org/2015-06-25-heygate-viability-assessment-finally-revealed/) for the Heygate redevelopment and is [advising](http://35percent.org/the-southwark-clearances/#completing-southwarks-clearances-with-savills) both Southwark and David Cameron on council estate regeneration policy.

![](http://35percent.org/img/savills.png)

In addition, we found that Savills used the same old tricks with Hadley's viability assessment as it used with the Heygate one; underestimating sales revenue; over-estimating build costs; using an excessive profit margin of 25%; and using market value (£8.4m) instead of Current Use Value (CUV) in the viability calculations. Obviously the value of the land is a key input in any viability assessment. The higher the figure, the less the scheme looks viable and vice versa. This is why Southwark's new planning policy for viability testing makes it clear that Current Use Value plus 20% uplift must be used and explicitly rejects market value from being used as the benchmark.

*Paragraph 38 of Southwark's [Development Viability SPD](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/13431/development_viability_spd)*
    
Had the viability assessment complied with policy and used CUV +20% (£6.9m) as the benchmark then at least an extra £1.15m would become available for extra affordable housing provision[^2].

Hadley's viability assessment also assumes a 25% developer profit, amounting to £17.6m. This is excessive - especially given the involvement of the Council and its land assets in the scheme. A recent development in Peckham submitted a [viability assessment](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!nspksmACnecLtzpJPG4%2fhw%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) assuming 16% developer profit. Why does Hadley require 25% profit? were it to assume a profit of 16% (ca. £10m) this would free up around £7m for the provision of extra affordable housing.

## Land give-away?
Curiously, Hadley's viability assessment doesn't include the cost of buying/leasing the Green Dale land from the Council. Does this mean that the Council is planning to hand over its [Green Dale land](http://35percent.org/img/LRegisterGreenDale.pdf) for the new stadium for free? could this be yet another gift to property developers?

Even more curiously, Council leader Peter John has [said publicly](http://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/final-plans-new-dulwich-hamlet-stadium-submitted/) _"I am opposed to the Hadley scheme"_, so we wonder why it is he is prepared to hand over the Council's land enabling the Hadley scheme to go ahead?

Meanwhile, Dulwich Hamlet FC's wikipedia page claims that its supporters have _"gained a reputation for the activist element of their support, with the fans behind the goal going by the nickname of "The Rabble"_ which have _"backed anti-discrimination and anti-homophobia initiatives."_

With the club urging supporters to [write in letters of support](http://www.pitchero.com/clubs/dulwichhamlet/news/dulwich-hamlet-new-stadium-support-the-application-1613670.html) to accompany Hadley's application, it remains to be seen whether 'The Rabble' will be backing this offshore developer's inequitable initiative to build luxury housing enabled by the loss of public land.

[^2]: The Current Use Value (CUV) is arguably reflected in the price Hadley [paid for the land](http://35percent.org/img/LRegisterDHFC.pdf) in 2014 of £5.75m. A better way to calculate it would be to take the current rent paid by the club and capitalise it using a yield of say 6% but that information has not been made available.
