The borough of Southwark contains a high proportion of social housing managed by housing associations - circa 17,000 according to a [recent Council report.](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s87983/Report%20The%20councils%20relationships%20with%20housing%20associations.pdf)

The majority of these are homes in new-build developments approved by the Council's planning committee and secured under section 106 agreements. According to [Council data](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning-policy-and-transport-policy/monitoring/authority-monitoring-report/housing?chapter=4) 15,237 affordable homes have been approved during the last 15 years alone, of which 9,200 are recorded as completed.

But the Council has no way of knowing if these affordable homes actually exist in real life, because once a development has been approved it relies purely on trust that the developer will deliver them.

*Quote from a [Dec 2019 Council briefing report](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/assets/attach/11530/alpha-report.pdf)*

This means that the Council doesn't know how much (if any) of the new homes built in the borough are meeting local housing need - i.e. are allocated to families on its housing waiting list (currently numbering more than 13,000), or remains so at future re-lets.

*Extract from [July 2019 Council scoping report](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/innovate/collabrative-project/affordable-housing-monitoring?chapter=5)*

We alerted the Council to this problem in 2015, showing how affordable homes were being sold on the open market or rented at higher rents. We raised it with the Local Government Ombudsman, who told the Council to introduce monitoring systems and conduct annual audits.

![](http://35percent.org/img/snauditpromise.png)

Five years on and the Council still hasn't got any monitoring system in place or any way of knowing how much affordable housing has been delivered, neither has it completed any audits. 

## Background - how we discovered the problem
The story began in 2015, when [we discovered](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2015/jul/21/neo-bankside-how-richard-rogers-new-non-dom-accom-cut-out-the-poor) that a high-profile development in the north of the borough had only delivered 62 of the 94 social rented homes required by the planning approval.

![](http://35percent.org/img/neoguardian.png)
*Guardian article exposing our findings at the Neo-Bankside development*

Shortly afterwards, we were contacted by a resident living in a new development at Elephant & Castle who was confused about an affordable housing tenant pack put through his letterbox. He was concerned that a similar trick had been pulled by the developer of his building, as he was paying market rent for his flat. He asked if we knew how to find out if his flat was supposed to be one of the 11 affordable homes in the building and what implications that would have.

![](https://omghcontent.affino.com/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/096/signal-building-MIN.jpg)
*The Signal Building at Elephant & Castle where affordable homes were let at market rent and then sold on the open market*

We told him that we had no way of knowing whether his home was one of the 11 affordable units and advised him to contact the Council.

It later [emerged](https://www.insidehousing.co.uk/insight/insight/the-court-battles-over-section-106-delivery--56141) that the housing association concerned had sold these and other affordable homes across the borough on the open market.

![](http://35percent.org/img/lhah.png)
*[https://www.insidehousing.co.uk/insight/insight/the-court-battles-over-section-106-delivery--56141](https://www.insidehousing.co.uk/insight/insight/the-court-battles-over-section-106-delivery--56141)*  

Concerned that there appeared to be no control over affordable housing delivery, we checked the Council's [choice-based letting system](https://www.southwarkhomesearch.org.uk/) and found homes approved as social rent being let at more than twice social rent levels.

![](http://35percent.org/img/nhghomesearch.jpg)
*Extract from the Council's [lettings system](https://www.southwarkhomesearch.org.uk) for households on its waiting list*

We then took a closer look and by cross-checking planning committee reports with section 106 agreements, Land Registry information, the [GLA affordable housing outturn dataset](http://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/gla-affordable-housing-programme-outturn/resource/0c87e5dc-f1e9-4edf-b246-bef6b40a9ba3) and [CORE lettings data](https://core.communities.gov.uk/), we compiled a long (but by no means exhaustive) [list](http://35percent.org/img/section106_tenure_breaches.pdf) of 46 schemes with potential breaches in affordable housing provision.

![](http://35percent.org/img/arexampless.png)

We sent this list to the Council asking them to investigate and complaining that there were no monitoring procedures. In January 2016, Southwark's Director of Planning [responded](/img/Stage1response28Jan2016.pdf) to our complaint saying _â€˜Southwark Council has appropriate safeguards in place and has not failed in its duties .. therefore your compliant is not upheld"._

We subsequently contacted Southwark's Cabinet member for Regeneration in an attempt to escalate the matter and in June 2016, we met with him and two senior planning officers. Again we were assured that the Councils monitoring procedures were sufficient and that there was no need to take the matter any further.

## The Ombudsman
Unsatisfied with the Council's seeming unwillingness to address the problem we referred our complaint to the Local Government Ombudsman.

In November 2016, the Ombudsman published a damning report showing that Southwark didn't actually have any procedures for monitoring the delivery of affordable housing.

![](http://35percent.org/img/LGOFinalDecisionSOR.png)

The Ombudsman directed Southwark to agree to introducing monitoring procedures and conduct an audit of all the section 106 affordable housing in the borough.  

![](http://35percent.org/img/lgoreport.png)

## The Audit - major discrepancies
In 2016, Southwark started the audit, which remains incomplete and marked by many basic error The Council's web page introducing the audit claims that _"there have been 4,320 affordable units secured by S106 legal agreements since 2001"_:

![](http://35percent.org/img/auditpara.png)

The first discrepancy we note is on the Council's [web page](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning-policy-and-transport-policy/monitoring/authority-monitoring-report/housing?chapter=9) introducing the audit which claims that _"there have been 4,320 affordable units secured by S106 legal agreements since 2001"_. The Council's [Housing delivery data](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning-policy-and-transport-policy/monitoring/authority-monitoring-report/housing?chapter=4) shows that there have been 15,237 affordable homes approved in the past 15 years alone:

![](http://35percent.org/img/grossapproved.png)

It is impossible to reconcile either of these two figures from the audit itself because it contains a large number of duplicates.

![](http://35percent.org/img/audit_extract.png)

Whilst Southwark acknowledges that the audit is a work in progress, for many major high-profile developments the tenure is still listed as 'Not Known' and several major schemes are entirely missing from the audit - e.g. phase 1 of the [Silwood estate regeneration](http://35percent.org/silwood-regeneration/) (ref:06/AP/0394 - site 4A).

![](http://35percent.org/img/swood4a.jpg)
*33 supposedly affordable homes on phase 1 of the Silwood estate regeneration - entirely missing from the audit*

In total, in over two thirds of the schemes, the audit shows that the Council still doesn't know who the housing association is. In many instances where the name of the housing association is listed, these no longer exist or have been taken over by other RSLs: Broomleigh Housing Association; Presentation Housing Association; Faithland Housing Association; Toynbee Housing Association; Family Mosaic Housing Association; Tower Homes; County & Securities Ltd.

The audit also lists developer Barratt Homes as managing affordable homes in a number of schemes. Barratt Homes is a developer - not a housing association.


The audit lists 65 affordable homes as being managed under an 'unknown tenure' in the redeveloped Samuel Jones industrial estate in Peckham by Ujima housing association. But Ujima housing association went bankrupt in 2009 after its directors were [accused of fraud](https://www.insidehousing.co.uk/news/news/two-charged-in-ujima-fraud-investigation-17552).

![](http://35percent.org/img/ujimafraud.png)

In schemes where the housing association has been correctly identified and the current tenure is known from their response, it is impossible to know whether this is the tenure required by the section 106 agreement. This is because the audit fails to include a column showing the tenure required by the section 106 agreement.

We looked briefly at a handful of the major schemes where we know the tenure required and found housing associations having provided affordable rent tenure instead of the social rent required by the section 106 agreement.

For example, phase 1 of the Aylesbury estate is listed as being let by L&Q at affordable rent (up to 80% market rent) but the s106 agreement for this scheme requires social rent.

Similarly phase 1 of the Canada Water regeneration required at least 123 homes at social rent. The audit shows these all at being provided at affordable rent by Affinity Sutton - a housing association which no longer exists.

Similarly, the 553-home Tabard Square scheme (02/AP/0168) was approved with a requirement for at least 79 social rented units. These are being listed as having been provided by Horizon Housing Association as affordable rent.

The audit clearly hasn't been conducted effectively. It remains impossible to know how much affordable housing has been delivered or whether it has been delivered under the tenure required by the section 106 agreement.


## Council stopped producing S106 monitoring reports
Southwark's failure to properly conduct the audit cannot be down to lack of resources. It charges developers a monitoring fee for monitoring ongoing section 106 compliance. For reasons unknown, Southwark stopped producing its [annual section 106 monitoring reports](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/section-106-and-community-infrastructure-levy/section-106?chapter=3) in 2014, so it is impossible to say exactly how much it has collected in monitoring contributions to date.

![](http://35percent.org/img/s106reports.png)

The Council currently charges developers Â£132.35 per affordable home for its monitoring requirements[^1]. If a similar fee has been charged for the 9,200 affordable homes supposedly completed in the last 15 years then it should have collected over Â£10m in pooled contributions.

>We call on the Council to disclose how much it has collected and details of how it has been spent with the re-institution of its annual s106 monitoring reports.
We also call on the Council to re-institute the affordable housing monitoring app and conduct a proper audit of affordable housing delivery in the borough.

Southwark is [reported](https://www.theplanner.co.uk/features/tech-landscape-how-a-simple-app-is-improving-affordable-housing-provision-in-southwark) as saying that it can't conduct the audit because it is unable to match the addresses of the affordable homes provided by the housing associations with the relevant planning consent.  

We accept that this may be time consuming and difficult in some cases but we don't accept that it is impossible. For example it should be relatively straightforward to match all of those schemes which have received grant funding from the Mayor. The Council should be able to access the GLA's [grant funding management system - called OPS](https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/funding/open-project-system-ops). The OPS system contains information on all of the schemes which have received funding under the GLA's various affordable housing programmes. Each grant is associated with a unique project ID, the GLA and local authority planning references, geo-coordinates, as well as the housing association's scheme ID.

According to [GLA records](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/gla-affordable-housing-programme-outturn?resource=0c87e5dc-f1e9-4edf-b246-bef6b40a9ba3) there have been 6,584 affordable homes built in Southwark using its grant funding in the past ten years alone. Matching these to their respective planning consents should be a relatively straightforward task.

For the affordable homes that have been provided without grant funding, the matching exercise will be more difficult but we can suggest a number of ways:

Housing associations should be asked to provide an up-to-date list of affordable homes they manage under section 106 agreements in the borough, along with their internal scheme ID. Manually matching address data against the Council's address/locational coordinates of the planning consent, it should be possible to match schemes one batch at a time rather than one address at a time.   

NB. Southwark records the geo-coordinates of each consented scheme - it [submits](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/be656e61-1647-4ebe-ace0-f3c0718574e1/london-s-housing-data-from-amr13) these to the GLA every year. They can be viewed on the GLA's LDD map here: [https://maps.london.gov.uk/land-development-database/](https://maps.london.gov.uk/land-development-database/)

Should any housing associations fail to cooperate, Southwark could search Land Registry records for all properties owned by that housing association. Local Authorities have unique access to these types of Land Registry searches: [https://www.gov.uk/guidance/hm-land-registry-ownership-and-extent-data](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/hm-land-registry-ownership-and-extent-data). There are also [paid services](https://use-land-property-data.service.gov.uk/datasets/nps) available, which provide GIS data with a UPRN lookup providing address and ownership data for a given building or land parcel.

We acknowledge that conducting a proper audit will be costly and time consuming, but each affordable home recovered through identified breaches will help the Council discharge its duty to house local families and ultimately save money on temporary accommodation costs - Southwark is currently spending over Â£10m per year on temporary accommodation.

![](http://35percent.org/img/sntemp.png)

It is also spending circa Â£350k per dwelling to build new Council homes, in order to meet desperate local housing need. Each affordable home recovered through an effective audit will provide a Â£350k saving to the Council. 

We call on Southwark Council to conduct a proper audit and publish a comprehensive list of the affordable homes secured by section 106 to date, along with approved and actually provided tenure details.

This list should be made public and searchable in order to dissuade housing associations from increasing rents beyond the levels permitted by the tenure secured in the section 106 agreement.
