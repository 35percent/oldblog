The Elmington regeneration is split into 10 blocks (A-J), of which F, H, I and J will be refurbished and the remainder redeveloped.

Sites A and B are currently being redeveloped By Notting Hill Housing Group, where [planning documents](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!XXOecz%2bOmRk2JFLLeX0iRw%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) confirm that it has [demolished](http://directobjective.blogspot.co.uk/2011/12/elmington-estate-revisited.html) 294 Council homes and replacing them with 279 homes and 117 car parking spaces in a 'mixed tenure' development that it has branded [Camberwell Fields](http://www.camberwellfields.com/).

The [planning committee report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!XXOecz%2bOmRk2JFLLeX0iRw%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) for Camberwell Fields confirms that of the 279 homes, 22 one & two bed units would be let at 'affordable rent' of 80% market rent and 41 three-bed units would be let at 65% market rent (which it misleadingly refers to as social rent elsewhere in the report).

The departure from the Council's policy requirement of providing (truly) social rented housing was justified by the submission by Notting Hill of a viability appraisal, which pleaded poverty. The [planning committee report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!XXOecz%2bOmRk2JFLLeX0iRw%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) said that Notting Hill's viability assessment had _"been scrutinised by a Property Valuer on behalf of the Council"_ and that _"the Valuer concluded that the appraisal was generally sound."_ - (para 75). However, the [GLA report](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/PAWS/media_id_204229/edmund_street_se5_report.pdf) for the application said that _"Southwark Council is assessing the viability appraisal in house."_ (para 32) 

## Right to return
[This Council report](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/mgConvert2PDF.aspx?ID=17695) flags up the problems associated with the higher rent levels approved, in relation to the promises made of a 'right to return' previously made to decanted tenants. It acknowledges discretely that these may not exercise their right to return because the replacement housing may not be _'tailored to their housing needs'_.

## Later phases
In July 2012, the Council's Cabinet [resolved](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s30291/Report%20Disposal%20of%20the%20Councils%20freehold%20interest%20in%20Elmington%20estate%20sites%20C%20D%20E%20and%20G%20Camberw.pdf) to sell sites C,D,E and G to a developer on the basis that replacement 1&2 bed 'social' housing would be affordable rent, capped at 65% market rent.

In Oct 2012 the Council's Cabinet [resolved](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=302&MId=4247&Ver=4) to issue a Compulsory Purchase Order on remaining leaseholders and tenants on phase 3 (Sites C, D, E and G).

Tenants and leaseholders are currently being 'decanted' i.e. [evicted](https://housingactionsouthwarkandlambeth.wordpress.com/2015/05/05/eviction-resistance-success-in-camberwell/) from these phases ahead of demolition. Tenants are being offered a 'right to return' to the new homes, but the affordability of the new 'affordable rents' puts this beyond the reach of most. Leaseholders are being offered shared ownership deals on the new homes, but the [rent and repayments](http://35percent.org/images/CamberwellFields.pdf) on these requires a minimum household income of at least £50k.

## The costs vs the benefits
In 2009, the Council [estimated](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s9280/Executive%20report.pdf) that refurbishing the estate would cost a total of £10m. 

By 2016, the Council had [spent](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/cost_to_date_of_elmington_estate?unfold=1#incoming-796509) £6.5m just on decanting and demolishing sites A&B.

Some [Land Registry deeds](/img/ElmingtonLR.pdf) show that the Council has sold off parcels of the estate to Notting Hill for just £1.

Other [Land registry deeds](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/LRegisterElmingtonAandB.pdf) suggest that the Council has sold sites A&B to Notting Hill for £11m.
