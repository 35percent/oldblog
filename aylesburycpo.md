Cabinet report approving equity loan scheme said it would be rolled out by NHG to new homes being built on the estate. This hasn't happened. 



The Mayor’s Affordable Housing SPG and Viability SPG (2017) says (emphasis added): “schemes which include the  loss  of  affordable  housing  will  be  required  to  ensure  that  existing affordable housingis replaced by better quality accommodation, providing at   least   the   equivalent   floorspace   of   affordable   housing.   The   Mayor expects existing affordable housing to be replaced on a like-for-like basis, meaning that, for example, homes at social rent levels should be replaced with homes at the same or similar rent levels."

n addition, the Mayor’s Draft Good Practice Guide to Estate Regeneration 2016  (CD74)  says  (emphasis  added)  “The  Mayor  believes  that,  where demolition and rebuilding is chosen as part of an estate regeneration, this should only happen where it does not result in a loss in social housing, or where  all  other  options  have  been  exhausted.  This  principle  will  apply  to estate regeneration projects that seek new funding from the GLA.” *pg 4, para 3

The Mayor's [Good Practice Guide for estate regeneration](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/better-homes-for-local-people-the-mayors-good-practice-guide-to-estate-regeneration.pdf) says _"For estate regeneration schemes, the existing affordable housing floorspace should be replaced on an equivalent basis, i.e. where social rented floorspace is lost, it should be replaced by general needs rented accommodation with rents at levels based on those in the homes that have been lost. The delivery of additional affordable housing should also be maximised."_ (para 10)


It also says (para 9): _"All such schemes, including estate regeneration schemes, are required to follow the ‘Viability Tested Route’ as set out in the draft new London Plan Policy H6 (‘Threshold approach to applications’)."_ which in turn requires an early-stage, a mid-stage and a late-stage review mechanism! (para E,2b). The failure to include these mechanisms means that the scheme fails to meet the Mayor's policy requirements for estate regeneration and his policy requirement to provide the maximum amount of affordable housing (policy 3.12)


The fact that phase 1a has been provided as affordable rent means that these circa homes should be discounted from the calculations.
