18 Blackfriars road scheme originally comprised a 23 and 42 storey tower put forward by a Malaysian joint venture called __'Black Pearl'__.


[Planning permission](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk:8190/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=externalDocuments&keyVal=_STHWR_DCAPR_9524215) for redevelopment of the site was [granted](http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/8237) when it was called in by the Secretary of State (Labour government in 2009), but apart from the demolition of the following period buildings on the site (including the Paper Moon pub) there was little progress until a new planning application was lodged in 2017. The new application increased the height of the buildings with the tallest now 53 storeys tall.
