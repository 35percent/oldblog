As a [condition](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/mgAi.aspx?ID=49413) of the [granting of planning approval](http://35percent.org/2018-07-09-delancey/) for the [redevelopment of Elephant & Castle's shopping centre](http://35percent.org/shopping-centre), Developer Delancey is obliged to provide a temporary facility for displaced independent traders,


Delancey have had to make another planning application to do this and [propose a 2/3 storey building](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!hAV0cqN%2bsOq%2febuFpH0spQ%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) on the recently completed _Castle Square_ market place near its adjoining development [Elephant One](http://35percent.org/tribeca-square/).  Castle Square is on land owned by Southwark Council, but currently [leased to Delancy on a peppercorn rent](http://35percent.org/2016-06-26-restricted-access-elephant-park/#elephant-parks).

The Castle Square boxpark would last for 5 years, until the Elephant & Castle Shopping Centre development has been completed, but traders have [objected](https://planning.southwark.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=neighbourComments&keyVal=_STHWR_DCAPR_9578882) that the proposed boxpark is too small and would have trading restrictions that would make it an impractical premises for many of the displaced businesses. [Delancey's proposals](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!hAV0cqN%2bsOq%2febuFpH0spQ%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) state that there is capacity for 33 independent traders, while the trader's own estimate is that there is a need to provide for over 100 existing traders. There are also many other issues, including the level of rents and service charges, the security of tenancy arrangements, selection criteria and disability access.

Delancey only secured a resolution to approve their shopping centre application after three planning committee hearings.  It must now get a further planning permission for the trader's temporary facility on Castle Square, before it can undertake any shopping centre redevelopment. 

We must ensure that the traders get the best possible deal, whatever happens; they need the temporary facility, but it must be better; if you would like to help achieve this, please submit the following objection - just fill out fields below and click 'Send Objection' button.

        <textarea name="message" id="message" cols="55" rows="10">Dear Southwark Planning,
Whilst this proposal is an attempt at mitigation against the detrimental impact of the redevelopment of the Elephant and Castle shopping centre on local independent traders, it requires amendment if it is to benefit the number of traders who need help.

I therefore support the comments and suggestions made by the Elephant Traders Association and Latin Elephant for improvements to the applicant's proposals, and ask that before any planning permission is granted that the size of the facility be increased to accommodate all the displaced independent traders who require new premises.

In addition, the following should first be agreed with the traders before the application is approved;
-	the rents and service charge levels
-	secure tenancy arrangements
-	selection criteria, should they be needed 
-	hours of trade
-	disability access
- 	the remit and format of a Traders Panel that truly represents their interests
- 	a sufficient relocation fund

Yours sincerely,
</textarea>
