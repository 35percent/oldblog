This was the first major development at the Elephant and Castle to be granted planning permission

The latest Elephant tower has begun to loom over the rubble of the Heygate estate. __Delancey DV4__'s _'Tribeca Square'_ is a suitably absurd name (Tribeca is a neighbourhood in Manhattan) for an absurd development - 270 student studios & 370 private residences for market rent with no affordable housing. Rents are [expected](http://crappistmartin.github.io/blog/2014/07/19/community-infrastructure-levy/) to be set at around £375pw for a 1-bed and £500pw for a 2-bed.

Tribeca Square is being built entirely using an [offsite prefabricated construction technique](http://www.laingorourke.com/media/news-releases/2015/laing-o-rourke-led-consortium-awarded.aspx) pioneered by Laing (the company that built the Heygate). Even the [bathrooms](http://www.modulor.ae/index.php?page=view_pages_detail&tbl_pages_id=eacf5a7153) are [prefabricated in Dubai](http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/7609).   

The Tribeca Square site was public land until 1987, it then housed an industrial estate which was demolished when the land was [sold](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/LR_DV4Eadon2006.pdf) in 2006 to [Delancey shell company](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/dv4.pdf) __Eadon Estates__ for £8.5m.

__Delancey DV4__ is a multimillion pound real-estate developer registered in the British Virgin Islands, which has been [accussed](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/PrivateEyeNo1311.pdf) of 'aggressive tax avoidance. It is funded by George Soros and managed by [Tory donor](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/party-funding-tory-coffers-benefit-from-fear-of-labour-mansion-tax-9716614.html) Jamie Ritblatt. 

## Planning gain giveaway 
__Eadon Estates__ very quickly secured planning approval after first acquiring the site in 2006. __Eadon Estates__ then [sold](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/LR_Eadon_2007.pdf) the site to __Eadon Limited__ in 2007 for £18.8m and in December 2008 __Eadon Limited__ went [back](linktoplanningapp) to Southwark's planning committee asking for variations in the site's planning permission.

This included adding 61 private residential units to the revised scheme, reducing the affordable housing to zero and making no payment in-lieu. A viability assessment was submitted to show that the development was not viable without these changes.

The [planning officer's report](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/Tribeca_OfficersReport.pdf) recommended approval of the variations, adding for good measure that the council's in-house valuers had confirmed that __ _"the negative effect of on-site social rented housing on the end values of the private units could in this case render the scheme financially unviable"_ __. The report explained that the design implications of providing a __ _"separate entrance for the affordable units would reduce the overall retail provision within the scheme which wouldn't support the planning objective of creating a strong and continuous retail frontage at the base of the towers."_ __
The report also claimed that __ _"it is not possible to show that the value from the additional 61 private residential units produces any additional value"_ __

## Southwark's loss... 
For failing to provide any on-site affordable housing, Delancey should have paid £52.7m under [Southwark's tariff](http://affordable.heroku.com/images/affordablehousingspg.pdf) for in-lieu affordable housing payments[^1]. It offered nothing and Southwark finally settled for a consolatory payment of just £1m[^2]. 

## Delancey's gain...
<img src="http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/TribecaSquare_VA.png" align="left" width="250" style="margin:10px">We show here the confidential [viability assessment](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/Delancey_Tribeca_ViabilityAssessment.pdf) Delancey submitted for this application. It states that the completed residential flats would sell for an average of just £525 per square foot. This is well below the £829 per square foot[^3] average sales price achieved by the neighbouring [Strata Tower](http://crappistmartin.github.io/strata-tower/) development. If we take this as the measure and multiply the difference by Tribeca's total residential square footage (247,079 sqft) we get a staggering £75 million undervaluation.

A different comparison would be against the current sales price of flats on the neighbouring Heygate redevelopment, the cheapest of which is a 1-bed flat [currently on sale](http://www.rightmove.co.uk/new-homes-for-sale/property-48785797.html) for £415,000 giving £967 per sqft; nearly double the Delancey estimate. Multiplying the Heygate/Tribeca difference by the total Tribeca floorspace gives an undervaluation of £109m. 

![](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/tribeca_rental.png)

The huge discrepancy between estimated and actual end sales values, might be explained to some extent by rising property values in the (sometimes prolonged) period between planning approval and completion. But even time-adjusted comparisons show that the original estimates for Tribeca Square were extremely pessimistic. The result is that Southwark has lost a great deal of affordable housing and Delancey have made a great deal of profit.

## Timeline
[Land Registry deeds]() show that the Industrial estate was built and owned by the Greater London Council then transferred to Southwark Council by the [London Residuary Body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Residuary_Body) in 1987. The industrial estate was then sold (date unknown) to 'The Mary Street Estate Ltd' of which [British Land is director](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/00042579/officers). 

was granted permission in March 2006. This original permission claimed that the high estimated cost (£4.6m) of the basement works, required for the access/service tunnel to the shopping centre, that it was unviable to provide any more than 5 shared ownership units. (See paragraph 170 of planning committee report [05/AP/1693](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/Data/Planning%20Committee/20060321/Agenda/Item%2063%20-%20Report%20-Castle%20Industrial%20Estate,%20Elephant%20Road,%20SE171LA.pdf)). 

Six months later, on 21st September 2006, the Mary Street Estate (British Land) sold the site to [__Eadon Estates Ltd__](https://services.gov.im/ded/services/companiesregistry/viewcompany.iom?Id=145829) (registered in Isle of Man) for the sum of £8.5m. 

On 2 March 2007 __Eadon Estates Ltd__ sold the land to [__Eadon Ltd__](https://services.gov.im/ded/services/companiesregistry/viewcompany.iom?Id=149600) for £18m.

In early December 2007 a revised planning application was [approved](http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/3077), which revised downwards the amount of affordable housing to be delivered.

A year later in the first week of December 2008 a further revised application was [approved](http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/3641). This removed the requirement for affordable housing altogether on the condition that the development provide a deep basement access/service tunnel to the shopping centre costing upwards of £11m instead.

In 2011 __Eadon Ltd__ [sold](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/LandRegistry_TribecaSquare.pdf) the site for £40m to __DV4 Eadon Ltd__ (another Delancey shell company registered in the British Virgin Islands). 

In 2013 former deputy council leader Kim Humphries [resurfaced](http://crappistmartin.github.io/blog/2013/12/07/kim-humphreys-exit-stage-left/) at the Elephant working for __Delancey__ as an [development consultant](http://carvil-ventures.co.uk/).

Rooms in the student block are currently being advertised for upwards of [£289 per week](https://www.casitaa.com/accommodation/81-portchester-house-london-uk) FOR A ROOM!

## Market Square
Delancey will be providing a new 'market square' on former Council-owned land neighbouring its development.

Para 6.29 of the [planning statement](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/tribecaplanningstatement.pdf) says affordable housing not viable because of market square.

![](http://35percent.org/img/castlesquare.JPG)
*Delancey's market square - currently under construction*

The square will be built on green space that was once part of the Heygate estate and was also known as Elephant Park.  The original Elephant Park was part of the [2.4 hectares of public green and amenity space](http://35percent.org/sustainable-development/) lost when the Heygate estate was demolished; designated as [Metropolitan Open Land (MOL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Open_Land) it was used by the local [Latin American football league](http://elephantamenity.wordpress.com/2011/02/28/no-more-football-on-the-elephant-park/), amongst others.

![](https://southwarknotes.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/elephant-rd.jpg)

In 2008, Southwark Council closed the Park and leased the land to Delancey for 99 years at £100 per annum (plus VAT). Southwark will also receive 50% of the net revenue from the new market (25% for the first five years). In 2012 Southwark  removed the MOL protective covenant  by including the land within the area of the [Heygate Compulsory Purchase Order](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/downloads/download/3287/heygate_compulsory_purchase-core_documents_and_proofs_of_evidence_list).
