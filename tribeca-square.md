__Elephant One__ was the first major development to be granted planning permission at the Elephant. It was originally to be called __Oakmayne Plaza__, but was subsequently renamed __Tribeca Square__ and then finally named __Elephant One__ after [protests from residents and the Council](http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/7373). It is not to be confused with Lendlease's similarly named and similarly shameful [__One the Elephant__](/one-the-elephant) development. 

__Elephant One__ comprises 270 student rooms & 370 private residences for market rent with no affordable housing of any kind. Rooms in the student block are currently being advertised for upwards of [£289 per week](https://www.casitaa.com/accommodation/81-portchester-house-london-uk) (for a room).

The development is being constructed entirely using an [offsite prefabricated construction technique](http://www.laingorourke.com/media/news-releases/2015/laing-o-rourke-led-consortium-awarded.aspx) pioneered by Laing (the company that built the neighbouring Heygate estate). Even the [bathrooms](http://www.modulor.ae/index.php?page=view_pages_detail&tbl_pages_id=eacf5a7153) are [prefabricated in Dubai](http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/7609).

The development is a joint venture between [Isle-of-Man registered](https://opencorporates.com/companies/im/004035V), [tax dodging developer](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/dec/16/london-property-tax-avoidance-offshore) Oakmayne and __Delancey DV4__ - a multimillion pound real-estate developer registered in the British Virgin Islands, which has been [accussed](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/PrivateEyeNo1311.pdf) of 'aggressive tax avoidance by the HMRC. Delancey is bankrolled by George Soros and managed by [Tory donor](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/party-funding-tory-coffers-benefit-from-fear-of-labour-mansion-tax-9716614.html) Jamie Ritblatt, son of property tycoon John Ritblat (__British Land Plc__). Delancey is also developing the neighbouring [shopping centre site](/shopping-centre) and is [using a network of offshore SPVs and holding companies](http://35percent.org/2014-05-05-manx-connections-the-off-shore-home-of-the-elephants-developers/) to avoid paying tax on its multi-million pound redevelopment of the Elephant.

## Planning History 
The site was originally a light industrial estate owned by the GLC until 1987 when it was transferred to Southwark Council. Southwark subsequently sold it to a subsidiary of __British Land Plc__, which in 2006 [sold](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/LR_DV4Eadon2006.pdf) it for £8.5m to [__Eadon Estates Ltd__](https://services.gov.im/ded/services/companiesregistry/viewcompany.iom?Id=145829), an anonymous SPV/shell company registered in Isle of Man. 

Having obtained planning permission for the site in December 2006, in March 2007 __Eadon Estates Ltd__ [sold the site](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/LR_Eadon2007.pdf) to [__Eadon Ltd__](https://services.gov.im/ded/services/companiesregistry/viewcompany.iom?Id=149600) (another anonymous Oakmayne/Delancey offshore SPV) for £18m.

__Eadon Ltd then submitted a [revised planning application in 2007](http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/3077), which revised downwards the amount of affordable housing to be delivered. It was approved on the basis that the developer would provide a number of affordable retail units and a market square for traders displaced from the shopping centre. It would also provide a basement area, which would be used as vehicular service access for the new shopping centre in order to reduce congestion.

A year later in the first week of December 2008, a further revised application was [approved](http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/3641), increasing the number of units and removing the affordable housing obligation altogether. The [planning officer's report](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/Tribeca_OfficersReport.pdf) for the application confirmed that the developer had submitted a viability assessment and that the Council accepted that _"it is not possible to show that the value from the additional 61 private residential units produces any additional value from which the scheme could support either on site affordable housing or an in lieu payment"_. Instead of affordable housing an in-lieu payment was agreed, amounting to just £1m[^2] and justified by the 'exceptional cost' to the developer of providing the market square and the basement access area - estimated to cost £12.5m. (see paragraphs 101-105). Delancey should normally have paid £52.7m under [Southwark's tariff](http://affordable.heroku.com/images/affordablehousingspg.pdf) for commuted affordable housing payments[^1].

Southwark later accidentally published the confidential [viability assessment](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/Delancey_Tribeca_ViabilityAssessment.pdf) submitted to justify these concessions. It showed that £18m had been used as the land purchase cost, as a result of the developer having flipped land registry ownership between the Eadon shell companies. It also claimed that the completed residential flats would sell for an average of just £525 per square foot. This is half of what flats on neighbouring [Elephant Park](http://elephantpark.co.uk) are selling for and represents an undervaluation of the development by around £100m! 

In 2011 __Eadon Ltd__ [sold](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/LandRegistry_TribecaSquare.pdf) the site for £40m to __DV4 Eadon Ltd__ (another Delancey shell company registered in the British Virgin Islands). 

## Affordable retail units sold to Sainsburys
The planning conditions in Delancey's 2008 final [s106 agreement](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!kx6tQZNPCJomdoeiotHphA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) made provision for [a number of affordable retail units](http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/2298) for traders displaced from the shopping centre[^5], which was one of its justifications for not providing any affordable housing[^6].

![](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/tribeca_affordablebusinessunits.png)
*Designated affordable retail units hatched in blue - (section 106 agreement)*

In July 2013, Delancey [went back](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?casereference=13/AP/2302&system=DC) to the council and [applied](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk:8190/online-applications/simpleSearchResults.do;jsessionid=EBCBBF9DAD6717E5F000A1CB21F842D6?action=firstPage) to have the s106 agreement changed to take these units away from the displaced traders and give them to Sainsburys instead. Southwark duly obliged and the entire ground floor is now a Sainsburys.

## Market Square without a market
![](/img/marketsquare.jpg)
*Delancey's market square - currently under construction*

The new market square that Delancey is obliged to build was once part of the Heygate estate's green space and was also known locally as Elephant Park. It was part of the [2.4 hectares of public green and amenity space](http://35percent.org/sustainable-development/) lost when the Heygate estate was demolished; designated as [Metropolitan Open Land (MOL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Open_Land) and was used frequently by the local [Latin American football league](http://elephantamenity.wordpress.com/2011/02/28/no-more-football-on-the-elephant-park/), amongst others.

![](http://35percent.org/img/oldelephantpark.jpg)

In 2008, Southwark Council closed the Park and [sold the land](http://35percent.org/img/DelanceyEadon_MarketSquare_Agreement.pdf) to Delancey on a 99 year lease at a peppercorn rent of £100 per year. The deal was that Southwark would receive 50% of the net revenue from the new market (25% for the first five years). Signing over the land would also mean Delancey could build the basement area under the market square that would provide access for servicing the new shopping centre.

![](http://35percent.org/img/castlesquarerent.png)
*Extract from market square [legal agreement](http://35percent.org/img/DelanceyEadon_MarketSquare_Agreement.pdf) between Delancey & the Council*

However, in 2016 Delancey [applied](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk:8190/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=summary&keyVal=_STHWR_DCAPR_9566927) to the Council to vary and remove the s106 conditions requiring use of the market square as a market. Delancey claimed there would be _"limited viability for a market or demand for an operator"_ in the short to medium term. The application was unquestioningly approved by Southwark and the market square has now been renamed 'Castle Square'.

*Extract from Delancey's [application](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk:8190/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=summary&keyVal=_STHWR_DCAPR_9566927) to vary market square s106 conditions*

Unfortunately Southwark forgot to insert a penalty clause in the [99 year lease agreement](http://35percent.org/img/DelanceyEadon_MarketSquare_Agreement.pdf) in the event that the market is not provided; so Delancey gets to keep the land on a peppercorn rent for 99 years, Southwark gets nothing in return and displaced shopping centre traders will not be accommodated. 

## £12.5m servicing basement shelved
The other obligation that went with the peppercorn lease of the land was that Delancey would build the basement under it to provide servicing access to the new shopping centre. The supposed £12.5m cost of building the basement, justified not just the removal of affordable housing but Delancey was also relieved of the £6.2m S106 contribution it should have paid for local transport infrastructure, according to Southwark's Strategic Transport Tariff[^7]. 

![](/img/servicetunnel.jpg)
*Entrance to the servicing basement on the Old Kent Road*

Now, having [submitted](http://35percent.org/2016-12-19-delancey-submits-shopping-centre-application/) its planning application for the shopping centre, Delancey claims that it no longer wants to use the underground basement as servicing access for the new shopping centre. Instead it wants a different access route directly off the New Kent Road.

![](/img/shoppingcentreaccess.png)

TFL have objected to this change of access, claiming that it will disrupt the flow of traffic and inhibit use of the new pedestrian crossings. Southwark has remained silent on the issue, despite it being a breach of its planning policy for the Elephant. If Delancey's plans are accepted then Southwark has no claw-back mechanism to ensure the basement is put to any other specific use. The basement sits underneath the market square, which was council-owned land given to Delancey on a 99 year peppercorn lease, in order to provide public infrastructure. We have already seen the market square shelved and if Delancey's shopping centre application is accepted then its land grab of the market square and basement land will be complete; Southwark will have signed over public land for private use on peppercorn rent for the next 99 years.    

## Revolving doors
If anyone is wondering how Delancey manages to get away with all this, the answer is that Delancey is very well advised. Delancey has employed former deputy Council leader Kim Humphries as its adviser and representative. Kim has been for hire as a freelance [development consultant](http://carvil-ventures.co.uk/) since he stepped down as deputy Council leader and Cabinet member for Housing. Kim is just one of many Council officers and Council members to have made use of Southwark's increasingly well-used [revolving doors](/revolving-doors).
