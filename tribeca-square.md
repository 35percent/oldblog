__Elephant One__ was the first major development to be granted planning permission at the Elephant. It was originally to be called __Oakmayne Plaza__, was subsequently renamed __Tribeca Square__ and then finally named __Elephant One__ after [protests from residents and the Council](http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/7373). It is not to be confused with Lendlease' similarly named and similarly shameful [__One the Elephant__](/one-the-elephant) development. 

__Elephant One__ comprises 270 student rooms & 370 private residences for market rent with no affordable housing. Rooms in the student block are currently being advertised for upwards of [£289 per week](https://www.casitaa.com/accommodation/81-portchester-house-london-uk) (for a room).

The development is being constructed using an [offsite prefabricated construction technique](http://www.laingorourke.com/media/news-releases/2015/laing-o-rourke-led-consortium-awarded.aspx) pioneered by Laing (the company that built the Heygate). Even the [bathrooms](http://www.modulor.ae/index.php?page=view_pages_detail&tbl_pages_id=eacf5a7153) are [prefabricated in Dubai](http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/7609).

The developer is __Delancey DV4__ - a multimillion pound real-estate developer registered in the British Virgin Islands, which has been [accussed](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/PrivateEyeNo1311.pdf) of 'aggressive tax avoidance by the HMRC. It is bankrolled by George Soros and managed by [Tory donor](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/party-funding-tory-coffers-benefit-from-fear-of-labour-mansion-tax-9716614.html) Jamie Ritblatt. Delancey is also developing the neighbouring [shopping centre site](/shopping-centre) and is [using a network of offshore SPVs and holding companies](http://35percent.org/2014-05-05-manx-connections-the-off-shore-home-of-the-elephants-developers/) to avoid paying tax on its multi-million pound redevelopment of the Elephant.

## Planning History 
The site was public land until 1987, it then housed an industrial estate which was demolished when the land was [sold](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/LR_DV4Eadon2006.pdf) in 2006 to [Delancey shell company](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/dv4.pdf) __Eadon Estates__ for £8.5m.

Six months later, on 21st September 2006, the Mary Street Estate (British Land) sold the site to [__Eadon Estates Ltd__](https://services.gov.im/ded/services/companiesregistry/viewcompany.iom?Id=145829) (registered in Isle of Man) for the sum of £8.5m. 

On 2 March 2007 __Eadon Estates Ltd__ [sold the site](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/LR_Eadon2007.pdf) to [__Eadon Ltd__](https://services.gov.im/ded/services/companiesregistry/viewcompany.iom?Id=149600) for £18m.

In early December 2007 a revised planning application was [approved](http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/3077), which revised downwards the amount of affordable housing to be delivered on the basis that the development would provide affordable retail units for traders displaced from the shopping centre.

A year later in the first week of December 2008 a further revised application was [approved](http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/3641). The [planning officer's report](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/Tribeca_OfficersReport.pdf) for the application confirmed that the developer had submitted a viability assessment from which the Council accepted that _"it is not possible to show that the value from the additional 61 private residential units produces any additional value from which the scheme could support either on site affordable housing or an in  lieu  payment"_. It removed the requirement to provide affordable housing altogether and instead accepted an in-lieu payment of just £1m[^2] on the basis that the exceptional costs of providing the market square and the basement access area, estimated to cost £12.5m to build. (see paragraphs 101-105). Delancey should normally have paid £52.7m under [Southwark's tariff](http://affordable.heroku.com/images/affordablehousingspg.pdf) for commuted affordable housing payments[^1].

Southwark accidentally published the confidential [viability assessment](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/Delancey_Tribeca_ViabilityAssessment.pdf) submitted for this application. It uses £18m as the land purchase cost as a result of having flipped land registry ownership between the Eadon shell companies. It also claimed that the completed residential flats would sell for an average of just £525 per square foot. This is half of what flats on neighbouring [Elephant Park](http://elephantpark.co.uk) are selling for and represents an undervaluation of the development by around £100m! 

In 2011 __Eadon Ltd__ [sold](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/LandRegistry_TribecaSquare.pdf) the site for £40m to __DV4 Eadon Ltd__ (another Delancey shell company registered in the British Virgin Islands). 

## Affordable retail units sold to Sainsburys
The planning conditions in Delancey's 2008 final [s106 agreement](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!kx6tQZNPCJomdoeiotHphA%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) made provision for [a number of affordable retail units](http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/2298) for traders displaced from the shopping centre[^5], which was one of its justifications for not providing any affordable housing[^6].

![](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/tribeca_affordablebusinessunits.png)

In July 2013, Delancey [went back](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?casereference=13/AP/2302&system=DC) to the council and [applied](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk:8190/online-applications/simpleSearchResults.do;jsessionid=EBCBBF9DAD6717E5F000A1CB21F842D6?action=firstPage) to have the s106 agreement changed to take these units away from the displaced traders and give them to Sainsburys instead. Southwark duly obliged and the entire ground floor is now a Sainsburys.

## Market Square without a market
![](/img/marketsquare.jpg)
*Delancey's market square - currently under construction*

The new market square is being built on green space that was once part of the Heygate estate and was also known as Elephant Park. The original Elephant Park was part of the [2.4 hectares of public green and amenity space](http://35percent.org/sustainable-development/) lost when the Heygate estate was demolished; designated as [Metropolitan Open Land (MOL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Open_Land) it was used by the local [Latin American football league](http://elephantamenity.wordpress.com/2011/02/28/no-more-football-on-the-elephant-park/), amongst others.

![](http://35percent.org/img/oldelephantpark.jpg)

In 2008, Southwark Council closed the Park and [sold the land](http://35percent.org/img/DelanceyEadon_MarketSquare_Agreement.pdf) to Delancey on a 99 year lease at a peppercorn rent of £100 per year. In return Southwark was due to receive 50% of the net revenue from the new market (25% for the first five years).

![](http://35percent.org/img/castlesquarerent.png)
*Extract from market square [legal agreement](http://35percent.org/img/DelanceyEadon_MarketSquare_Agreement.pdf) between Delancey & the Council*

However, in 2016 Delancey [applied](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk:8190/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=summary&keyVal=_STHWR_DCAPR_9566927) to the Council to vary the s106 conditions governing the market square. Delancey claimed there would be _"limited viability for a market or demand for an operator"_ and its application was approved.

*Extract from Delancey's [application](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk:8190/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=summary&keyVal=_STHWR_DCAPR_9566927) to vary market square s106 conditions*

Unfortunately Southwark forgot to insert a penalty clause in the [99 year lease agreement](http://35percent.org/img/DelanceyEadon_MarketSquare_Agreement.pdf) in the event that the market is not provided; so Delancey gets to keep the land on a peppercorn rent for 99 years, Southwark gets nothing in return and displaced shopping centre traders will not be accommodated. 

## £12.5m servicing basement shelved
Delancey successfully argued that the provision of the £12.5m basement to service the new shopping centre, meant that it couldn't viably provide any affordable housing and couldn't afford to pay the £6.2m required according to Southwark's Strategic Transport Tariff to pay for necessary transport capacity improvements[^7]. Having pleaded viability poverty, Delancey was allowed to pay a token contribution of just £280k - (see paragraph 105 of the [planning committee report](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/Tribeca_OfficersReport.pdf)). This has left Southwark Council in the position of having to use public funds to close an [Elephantine funding gap](http://35percent.org/2014-08-12-mind-the-gap/).

![](/img/servicetunnel.jpg)
*Entrance to the servicing basement on the Old Kent Road*

Now, having [submitted](http://35percent.org/2016-12-19-delancey-submits-shopping-centre-application/) its planning application for the shopping centre, Delancey claims that it no longer wants to use the underground basement as an access route for the new shopping centre. Instead it wants a different route directly off the New Kent Road near the roundabout.

![](/img/shoppingcentreaccess.png)

TFL have objected to this change of access, claiming that it will disrupt the flow of traffic and inhibit use of the new pedestrian crossings. Southwark has remained silent on the issue, despite it being a breach of its planning policy for the Elephant. If Delancey's plans are accepted then Southwark has no claw-back mechanism to ensure the basement is put to any other specific use. The basement sits underneath the market square, which was council-owned land given to Delancey on a 99 year peppercorn lease, in order to provide public infrastructure. We have already seen the market square shelved and if Delancey's shopping centre application is accepted then its land grab of the market square and basement land will be complete.    

## Revolving doors
If anyone is wondering how Delancey manages to get away with all this, the answer is that Delancey is very well advised. Delancey has employed former deputy Council leader Kim Humphries as its adviser and representative. Kim has been for hire as a freelance [development consultant](http://carvil-ventures.co.uk/) since he stepped down as deputy Council leader and Cabinet member for Housing. Kim is just one of many Council officers and Council members to have made use of Southwark's increasingly well-used [revolving doors](/revolving-doors).
