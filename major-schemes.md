  housing need

The last ten years has seen a flurry of high-profile, high-density, high-rise developments approved in Southwark - but how have they benefitted the local community? The following table shows the major schemes approved over approximately the last ten years and the number of social rented homes provided in each development.

__Total: 11,863 New Homes__  
__Social rented: 456 (3.8%)__

Southwark's planning policy says that 35% of all new homes must be affordable of which 70% must be social rented, except for certain areas such as Elephant & Castle/Camberwell (where the split is 50% social rented/50% shared ownership). Just over half (6135) of the 11,863 homes in the schemes listed above are in areas with a 50/50 tenure split requirement, the remainder require a 70/30 split.

On this basis it can be said that had Southwark stood firm and forced these schemes to comply with policy then it would have secured approximately 2,500 social rented homes in total. In the event it secured just 456. Had it stood firm there would have been 2,000 extra social rented homes available to those on its housing waiting list.

In a small number of the schemes, developers have provided a 'commuted sum' in lieu of providing affordable housing. However, as [pointed out by local news site SE1](http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/8222) these commuted sums are often equal to the price of just one of the penthouse apartments. The total amount received in commuted sums to date is Â£60m[^1].

It is also fair to say that some of the schemes have provided 'affordable rent' instead of social rent, which is anything up to 80% of market rent (approx 500 in total). We have not included these because they are not affordable to the majority of Southwark residents, especially those on the housing waiting list. There also remains a question about whether the small number of social rented units secured at planning approval are actually being provided as such. Our [research](http://35percent.org/redefining-social-rent/) would suggest otherwise.
