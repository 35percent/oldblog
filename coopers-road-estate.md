Coopers road estate was situated next to the Avondale Square estate, just off the Old Kent road next to the fire station.

It comprised 196 council homes in five blocks - two 15-storey tower blocks (Yeoman Court & Marchant Court) and three lower level maisonette blocks. 

The estate was redeveloped as part of the ['Southwark Estates Initiative'](http://embed.verite.co/timeline/?source=0Aprl6XcACewydEhRaWFOLVBfUjBSVW1HUGVZNEhGeFE&font=Bevan-PotanoSans&maptype=toner&lang=en&hash_bookmark=true&start_zoom_adjust=2&height=650#1), a regeneration strategy devised by Southwark's Labour administration as part of New Labour's 'Urban Task Force' urban renewal strategy.

## Phases 1 & 2
[Phases 1 and 2](http://www.maxfordham.com/projects/coopers-road-estate) were completed in 2006 by Peabody Housing association & its development partner [Countryside Properties](http://www.countryside-properties.com/). Phase 1 completed in 2005, consisted of 74 units for social rent. It is not known how many of these have since been converted to affordable rent. Phase 2 completed in 2008 consisted of 80 dwellings of which 33 were shared ownership and the remainder for private sale.

# Phase 3
Phase 3, which also incorporated a victoria factory was demolished in 2010. The replacement development _"Success House"_ was completed in 2012.

The [section 106 agreement](/img/coopersroadestate_section106.pdf) for phase 3 shows that of the 46 new homes approved at _"Success House"_, 14 will be shared ownership and none will be social rented.

Appended to the section 106 agreement are also the deeds of sale showing that the Council sold the land in the separate phases of the estate to Peabody for the following amounts:

 * Phase 1: £810,632
 * Phase 2: £1.5m
 * Phase 3: £689,416

## Phase 4
The final phase of the regeneration was completed in 2015. This [Cabinet report](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s26116/Report%20Disposal%20of%20Land%20at%20Coopers%20Road%20SE1.pdf) from the Council's Cabinet member for Housing, Cllr Richard Livingstone, shows how ambiguous terms serve to blur the boundaries between social and affordable rent:

However the [planning committee report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!LxiP99PHNyQALLSNryD5lQ%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) was clear that at least 9 of the 47 units in phase 4 would be provided as social rent. But [GLA data](http://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/gla-affordable-housing-programme-outturn/resource/0c87e5dc-f1e9-4edf-b246-bef6b40a9ba3) shows that these have been provided as affordable rent. Peabody's phase 4 development is included in our [complaint](http://35percent.org/redefining-social-rent/) to the Council about its misuse of the term 'social rent' by allowing its substitution for affordable rent - in breach of planning conditions.

[Land Registry deeds](/img/LRegisterCoopersRoadPhase4.pdf) for phase 4 show that the Council sold this phase to Peabody for £1.09m.

This brings the sum total of capital receipts the Council received for the sale of the (circa 5-acre) estate to £4.09m.

## Sink estate rhetoric
David Turrent from [ECD Architects'](https://ecda.co.uk), the architects behind the Coopers estate regeneration, wrote a [chapter](/img/coopersestate_sustainableurbandesign.pdf) in [this book](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tRldAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA97&lpg=PA97&dq=coopers+road+estate+regeneration+success+house+completed&source=bl&ots=d5QjxMgu4V&sig=Gx6dj9J-UTcqtJluk-ebF54lV1c&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwil0PqMocXMAhUECsAKHQAJBnYQ6AEIPDAF#v=onepage&q=coopers%20road%20estate%20regeneration%20success%20house%20completed&f=false), where he describes Coopers Road as _"a failing 1960s estate in need of consiberable investment; the high-rise deck-access blocks lent themselves to anti-social behaviour and the open space between buildings was poorly used and lacked surveillance."_
