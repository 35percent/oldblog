## Elephantshopping centre planning application narrowly approved

Shopping centre owner and developer Delancey propoals for the shopping centre (link) narrowly secured approval from the planning committee last Tuesday (link SE1).  The approval is subject to Mayor Sadiq Khan endorsing the decision and the successful conclusion of S106 negotiations, to seal the legal contract between Southwark and Delancey for the delivery of the development.  A late application to Historic England for listing the shopping centre has also to be resolved.

## Winners and losers

Southwark's planning officer's were frank when presenting the merits of the application - there were going to be positives and negatives (the negatives known as 'disbenefits').  In the positive column were a new Northern Line tube entrance, a new London College of Communication campus for University of the Arts London, new homes and new shops.  In the negative column was the displacement of the current traders and the unaffordability of the new homes and new shops for local people, or indeed for most people in Southwark.  The committee satisfied itself that the price required was worth paying and that the so-called mitigation measures were sufficient to allow a vote in favour of the development.  The committee was wrong.  The decision it had to make might be difficult, but it ignored the housing policy that was designed to guide it in making such decisions.  This lays out clearly how much affordable housing is required, what type it should be and how much should be social rented.  Instead it chose to measure the affordable housing offer against a so-called 'emerging' policy that is championed by Delancey and other developers, because it leaves them in control of the affordable housing (though not the social rented on this occasion).  This led it to approve a development with half the affordable housing at 80% market rent, a type of housing it has previously stated does not meet Southwark's housing need (link).

Looked at from the traders' perspective the committee again made the wrong decision.  It chose to accept the reassurances of council officers that all that could be done to mitigate the harm the traders would suffer was being done.  The committe despite the traders objections that there was no relocation strategy in place, that the relocation fund was inadequate (£634,700 - an estimated average of about £6000 per trader) and that their businesses were being ruined by Delancey's poor upkeep of the centre, as well as future uncertainty; they had been told by Delancey they would have to  leave the centre by March 2019, regardless of the oucome of the planning application.  A trader's panel is now to be put in place to solve these problems.  

Southwark is also content that it is fulfilling its public sector equality duty, that it has had due regard for the harm the development will cause to ethnic minority groups, but it has been warned by Southwark Law Centre and Latin Elephant that it has ignored other protected groups, such as women and the young.  Palaces' bingo and bowling has withdrawn its objection to the application, but council officers acknowledged that allowing allowing a bingo operator first right of refusal for the use of some leisure space does not guarantee the bingo will return in the new development; nor does it solve the problem of where bingo users, the majority from black and ethnic minority backgrounds, do between the years of the centre's demolition and completion of the new development.  The bowling alley, much used by young people does not benefit from even the small protection given to the bingo.

## The cost to Dleancey - £260,000

The justifiction for accepting a proposal that drove a horse and carriage through its housing policy and displaces the Latin American and ethnic community who have made the Elephant their social home was 'viability'.  Delancey told the committee that their estimated level of profit was at 'breaking point' and nothing more could be offered in the way of affordable housing, but then stunned everyone but themselves  with the admission that it was only paying £260,000 towards the extra 42 social rented units (lifting the number from 74 to 116 units) the rest of the cost being met by a GLA affordable housing grant of £11.25m, thus maintaining Delancey's estimated profit at £147m.

The estimated profit has varied from £153m to  £136m over the course of the application and currently stands at £147m, benefiting from a £11.25m GLA affordable housing grant.
