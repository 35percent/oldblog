The Aylesbury estate regeneration was initiated by Tony Blair as part of New Labour's '[Urban Task Force](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towards_an_Urban_Renaissance)' inner-city renewal programme. He chose the Aylesbury as the location for his inaugural ['forgotten people'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_HGgT--AGs) speech, directly after being voted in as prime minister in 1997.

It was subsequently awarded £56m funding under the ['New Deal for Communities'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Deal_for_Communities) partnership as part of Blair's urban renewal programme.  

## Failed Ballot
![](http://betterelephant.org/images/novote.png)

In 2001, residents on the estate were balloted on the prospect of stock transfer and redevelopment by a Housing Association. There was a high turnout (73%) and over 70% of residents [voted against](http://www.theguardian.com/society/2001/dec/27/1) the proposals. [This council Executive report](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/Data/Executive/20050927/Agenda/Item%2007%20-%20The%20AylesburyEstate%20Revised%20Strategy%20-%20Report.pdf) postulates that one of the reasons behind the 'NO' vote was that residents were concerned that they would have to pay higher rents and service charges on the redeveloped estate.  

![](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/aylesburyballot.png)

In 2002, the council's Head of Housing Regeneration [said](http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/journals/insidehousing/legacydata/uploads/pdfs/IH.020222.028f.pdf) it was planning to press ahead with the redevelopment regardless, claiming that bringing the existing estate up to scratch would cost £200 million, a sum that the council simply didn't have. 

## Social or 'affordable' rent?
Residents' concerns about Housing Associations charging higher rents turned out to be well founded, when it [emerged](/2015-09-24-southwark-backs-down-over-bermondsey-spa-dispute/) that Notting Hill Housing (the council's development partner) had secured funding for the scheme, linked to the provision of _affordable rent_ rather than _social rent_ (nevertheless capped (initially) at around 50% rather than 80% market rent). However, even capped at 50% market rent Southwark's own [housing data](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/downloads/download/2914/affordable_rent_in_southwark_2011) shows that the minimum income required to afford this, is twice what Southwark council tenants earn on average. However, the crucial difference between social rent and affordable rent is that the latter is linked to market rents, which in Southwark are increasing at well over 10% per annum.

![](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/affordable_rent_50percent.png)

In 2015, Southwark conducted an [Affordable Rent Study](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/downloads/download/2914/affordable_rent_in_southwark_2011), which concluded that _"as market rents are very high in Southwark, significant incomes are required to afford high proportions of market rent, but average incomes of people living in Southwark are low."_ The study [showed](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/13082/affordable_rent_study_-_december_2015) that a single person on the average median income for Southwark cannot afford more than 26% market rent and that a lone parent working on average income cannot afford more than 14% market rent.

*Southwark Affordable Rent Study 2015*

The same [affordable rent study](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/downloads/download/2914/affordable_rent_in_southwark_2011) shows that social rent in Southwark reflects these very low incomes; the [study data](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/13083/affordable_rent_study_xls_-_december_2015) shows us that a social rent in Southwark for a 1-bed flat is £96.88 on average (incl. service charge), which works out to be 25.5% of market rent for a 1-bed (£378.79); a 2-bed social rented flat is £110.76 per week on average (24.2% market rent); a 3-bed is £124.18 pw (22.5% market rent); a 4-bed is £139.69 (19.3% market rent). These figures are a lot lower than the 35%-40% and 50% of market rent routinely quoted by Councillors, council officers and developers as social rents or their equivalents.

![](/img/AffordableRentStudy2015.png)
*Southwark's Affordable Rent Study 2015 showing average weekly market and social rents*

The council insists that all new rented homes will be social rented not affordable rent, but [revelations](http://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/council-takes-no-legal-action-over-44-missing-social-housing-units/) that Notting Hill had delivered affordable rent instead of the social rent agreed at its Bermondsey Spa regeneration, have further thrown these promises into doubt. The [long list](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/section106_tenure_breaches.pdf) of similar tenure switches we have identified shows that this sleight-of-hand is a widespread practice, which appears to be tolerated by Southwark. 

The council also insists that Notting Hill has a contractual obligation to provide social rent rather than affordable rent in the redevelopment. But its [contractual agreement](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/LBS_NHHT_DPAgreement.pdf) contains no reference to the term social rent whatsoever. Instead it refers just to 'target rent’ set by government, without any reference to the term __social rent__ or the National Rent Regime regulatory framework which governs it. There is an obvious concern that this could be interpreted as affordable rent, as there are'target rents' for both __social rent__ and __affordable rent__ set by government.

![](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/Aylesbury_targetrent.png)

In any case Notting Hill's [planning application](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!clWxEC35adJ29O7pMe62Bg%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) for the redevelopment admits that there will be an overall loss of 934 social rented units through the redevelopment (even if the replacements were to be social, not affordable rent:

![](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/aylesburyahstatement.png)

We note that the replacement social housing is referred to ambiguously as both as social rent and affordable rent throughout the planning application documents and that these would be [material considerations](http://www.11kbw.com/blogs/local-government-law/ambiguous-planning-permission/806) should there later be any dispute about the precise definition of the tenure provision intended. 

We also note Notting Hill's predilection for affordable rent. Indeed, its CEO Kate Davies was a [fellow](http://www.centreforsocialjustice.org.uk/about-us/csj-fellows/kate-davies) of the [Centre for Social Justice](http://www.centreforsocialjustice.org.uk/) - the conservative think tank set up and chaired by Iain Duncan Smith, which conceived the idea of both affordable rent and right-to-buy for housing association tenants.

![](http://pbs.twimg.com/media/CNUmHQlWIAAdSyI.png)

Kate Davies co-authored [this report](http://www.centreforsocialjustice.org.uk/UserStorage/pdf/Pdf%20reports/HousingPoverty.pdf) by the CSJ, in which she claimed that council estates are _‘ghettos of the poorest and neediest people’_ that are _‘subsidised by the taxpayer’_ and provide _‘low cost living for life funded from the public purse’_. She said that tenants _‘often pay little or no rent, and get their home maintained in good order for free.’_ She concluded that _‘social housing is not a desirable destination’_ and that _‘private ownership is preferable to state provided solutions’_.

When the unpopular social housing reforms were being pushed through parliament by the conservatives in 2011, Notting Hill Housing was one of the few housing providers to write in support of the affordable rent proposals. In its [official consultation response](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/8483/2109183.pdf) it wrote: _“Notting Hill strongly welcomes the Government’s social housing reforms. They will lead to a significant increase in the provision of new social housing, with the higher levels of income that associations will receive from affordable rent tenancies.”_

## Harvard Gardens
![](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/site7.jpg)

The most recent phase of the scheme [(site 7 - Wolverton/'Harvard Gardens')](http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/lq-wins-work-on-next-phase-of-aylesbury-plan/6522708.article) is being developed by L&Q and comprises 147 new homes, of which 48 will supposedly be for 'social rent'. However, the [section 106 planning agreement](http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/279910_1.pdf) for the site says __'affordable rent'__ and a [question](http://questions.london.gov.uk/QuestionSearch/searchclient/questions/question_283539) put to the Mayor confirms that these will be let at __affordable rent__ of up to 50% market rent.

![](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/wolvertonss106_mayorquestion.png)

In October 2015, we managed to obtain the [actual rent levels](http://35percent.org/2015-10-12-notting-hill-comes-clean/) proposed by Notting Hill for its first phase of the Aylesbury. These confirmed that rents are being determined as a percentage of market rent and not using the National Rent Regime formula for social rents. They also illustrate the main difference between social and affordable rent, namely that affordable rents rise in line with market rent trends. This is shown by the fact that rents in later stages of the phase are higher as a result of projected increases in market rents over the coming years. Were they truly social rents then they would actually decrease by 1% each year.
   
## Refurb vs Demolition
At the 2015 CPO Public Inquiry, Professor Jane Rendell from the Bartlett School of Architecture questioned the council's cost/benefit appraisal for its decision to redevelop rather than refurbish. She took the Inquiry through all of the figures and showed that cost estimates for refurbishment had been inflated by nearly £150m. (See [AJ article](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/ajaylesbury.pdf)).

Objectors gave evidence showing that later phases of the estate had been allocated funds under the council's [WDS programme](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/info/200510/major_works/3407/1_what_is_warm_dry_and_safe) (Decent Homes Standard works programme). They showed the Inquiry [section 20 invoices](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/DHS_MajorWorks_Section20Invoice.pdf) that they had been sent by the council, detailing the estimated cost of the Decent Homes Standard major works charges, i.e. bringing the homes up to modern standards. These showed that homes on the estate were being brought up to Decent Homes Standard at an average cost of just £20,261 per home[^1]. 


It was also [confirmed](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/Email14April2015_KReed.pdf) during the course of the Public Inquiry, that the council has spent a staggering £46.8m on the Aylesbury regeneration scheme to date. This has comprised total capital account costs of £32.1m (demolition & acquisiton) and revenue account costs amounting to £14.7m (Management & Administration).

The council has therefore spent £46.8m demolishing and redeveloping 112 homes[^2] on the scheme to date (£417k per home), compared to the £20,261 per home it is spending bringing homes up to Decent Homes Standard elsewhere on the estate.

When the Council Executive took its [decision](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/CeListDocuments.aspx?CommitteeId=118&MeetingId=986&DF=27/09/2005&Ver=2) to redevelop the estate in September 2005, it did so on the basis of a [costings estimate](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/annexc.pdf) which calculated that the scheme would incur an overall cost to the Council of £16.1m over the scheme's 10-year development period. However, the Council's [budget books](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/11869/budget_book_201516_-_capital_programme) show that it is spending nearly £14m on the Aylesbury scheme during the past year alone. Later figures showed that the Council's estimated cost of decanting and demolishing the estate had ballooned to £150m[^4], but it is likely that even this figure will now be well exceeded.

![](/img/landassembly.png) 

Other London boroughs take a different approach to regeneration. Islington has an estate called the Six Acres estate near Finsbury Park. The Six Acres estate was built at the same time as Heygate & Aylesury, by the same contractors (Laing) using the [same system](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/LBI_SixAcres_Jespersen12M.pdf) (Jespersen 12M). 

Instead of demolshing its estate and handing it over to the private sector at a loss, Islington Council chose to refurbish the Six Acres estate in 2012. The 473 homes on the estate were refurbished with [new external wall insulation](http://www.lawtechltd.co.uk/Project_Tollington.aspx), new entry doors, exterior furnishing improvements, [green roofs](http://www.langley.co.uk/asx/six_acres_case_study.pdf) and [cycle shelters](http://greenroofshelters.co.uk/green-roofed-cycle-shelters-for-islington/).

The entire Six Acres estate refurbishment and public realm improvement works cost a total of just £5.15m. This works out at around £10k per dwelling; far less than the Council is spending per dwelling on demolishing the Aylesbury.  

Extensive [research by the University College London](http://www.engineering.ucl.ac.uk/engineering-exchange/demolition-refurbishment-social-housing/) and [case studies](https://heygateestate.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/genslerheygate.pdf) by leading architects has shown that refurbishment is better not just financially, but also socially and environmentally.

## Design Criticisms
Clearly the business case for refurbishment is much stronger than that for demolition. However, Southwark says it's not about the fabric of the estate but its design. In her [Public Inquiry evidence](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/Catherine_Bates2.pdf), Southwark's in-house architect confirmed that _"the condition of the buildings does not, itself present a case for demolition and redevelopment"_ but that the _"fundamental issue is the estate layout and the poor urban environment this presents"_. In paragraph 5.3 of her evidence she gives examples of this 'poor urban environment' which include criticisms that: 

 * _"The scale and orthogonal formation of the blocks (some of the longest in Europe) does not correspond to human scale, nor does it create opportunities for neighbourliness and local neighbourhood identity."_

 * _"The estate roads, which serve to access gargages, typically terminate in dead ends, and have little relationship to front doors of dwellings"_. This means that _"residents are deprived of a clear address, and identity, and experience various practical inconvenincies i.e. deliveries finding it difficult to locate front doors."_

 * _"Lack of ownership"_ of the estates green spaces, means that _"they are under used"_.

So translating the architect speak to plain English we can say that Southwark is spending twice as much demolishing the Aylesbury estate than it would cost to refurbish it, on the grounds that the green spaces are _"under used"_ and the lack of a traditional street layout _"deprives"_ residents of a _"clear identity"_. 

More criticisms of the estate and grounds for its demolition can be found in other officers' proofs of evidence submitted to the Public Inquiry:

[Jackie Fearon - Aylesbury Area Manager, Southwark Council](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/Jackie_Fearon.pdf)  
[Elaine Taylor - Senior Regeneration & Development Manager, L&Q Housing](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/Elaine_Taylor.pdf)  
[Mark Maginn - Sales & Acquisitions Manager, Southwark Council](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/Mark_Maginn.pdf)

[Jane Seymour - Development Partnership Broker, Southwark Council](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/Jane_Seymour.pdf)  

One fact that receives little mention in the CPO papers is that the Aylesbury estate is not exclusively concrete construction; there are over 300 brick built properties on the estate equally earmarked for demolition.

## Bridging the (viability) gap
In Jan 2009 the AAAP table A7.2 allowed £130.422m for leasehold acquisitions. This should have covered the purchase of 392+54+36=__482__ properties. 

In May 2009 the [AAAP](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/downloads/download/4444/area_action_plans) was revised to allow only £65.73m for leasehold acquisitions. There is no evidence available to justify this decision. When questioned as part of the public inquiry into the Aylesbury compulsory purchase order, the Council said that it had been an officer decision and that the IDM report justifying the decision to revise the leaseholder buyback budget had gone missing.

Even with the lower figure of £65.73m, the AAAP was still unviable and showed a funding gap of £82.63m.

![](/img/aaapfundinggap.png)
*Extract from [Aylesbury Area Action Plan 2010](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/downloads/download/4444/area_action_plans) showing the funding gap*

It is presumed that the Council reduced the leaseholder buyback budget in order help try and bridge the funding gap. A requirement of an Area Action Plan is that it must generally be seen to be viable.

The AAAP goes on to explain possible scenarios for bridging this funding gap, which include _"delivering different and more financially viable tenure mixes"_.

![](/img/aaapbridgingthegap.png)
*Extract from AAAP*

Development schemes in Southwark are currently [delivering](http://35percent.org/2016-05-07-southwark-in-bottom-3-boroughs-for-affordable-housing-delivery/) on average 3% affordable housing, largely with social rent substituted for affordable rent. So we find it hard to believe that Notting Hill can deliver a scheme with 50% affordable housing comprising 75% social rent. We find it even more difficult to believe that Notting Hill is also expecting to extract a 15% profit margin (representing ca. £150m) and Southwark is also expecting to receive payments for the land. 

Despite its new [transparency policy](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/news/article/2062/viability_assessments_must_be_published_in_southwark_%E2%80%93_consultation_launched) the Council has rejected our request for a copy of Notting Hill's [viability report](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/NHHT_AylesburyViabilityAssessment.pdf) for the Aylesbury redevelopment. Despite being a registered charity, Notting Hill has claimed commercial confidentiality as the grounds for its redactions. In April 2016, the Information Commissioner upheld our complaint and directed Southwark Council to disclose the unredacted viability report. Watch this space!

It's important to note that Notting Hill won't be building the new homes. This has been [contracted](http://www.nottinghillhousing.org.uk/our-developments/aylesbury-estate-southwark) to Barratt Homes in a joint-venture agreement, which will see Barratt also receive a healthy slice of the profits. Before Notting Hill takes its slice, Barratt will receive a 21% priority return and half the remaining profit from the sale of private units in the development.

![](http://35percent.org/img/barratprofit.png)

The Council has [argued](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/news/article/2041/brand_new_library_plans_take_next_step_on_aylesbury) that the regeneration is providing public benefits including a new (replacement) library, a new (replacement) GP clinic, and new (replacement) nursery facilities. But what is not publicised is the fact that these are all being funded 100% by the Council, they are not being funded by Notting Hill or its development partner Barratt.

In conclusion, the Aylsebury redevelopment is not viable. It is only being made viable via a combination of huge public subsidy from the Council, shortchanging the leaseholders and substituting social for affordable rented tenure.

## Environment/Sustainability
The Aylesbury estate masterplan outline planning application gave consent for a total of 1,378 parking spaces in the new development, equating to four out of ten new households with parking.[^3]

The [officer's report](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!Vbu5QpckfYCnJrulzlWyuQ%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) for the Aylesbury masterplan application also confirms that there will be a net loss of 1.8 hectares of open space as a result of the redevelopment:

![](http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/aylesburygreenspace.png)

Further, the new open spaces in the development will not be public open spaces adopted by the council; they will be privately owned and managed by a subsidiary of Notting Hill Housing Group.

## Aylesbury diaspora
Loretta Lees, a leading professor of Human Geography has [published](http://theconversation.com/camerons-sink-estate-strategy-comes-at-a-human-cost-53358) a study researching the displacement of Aylesbury estate tenants as a result of the regeneration. 

![](https://62e528761d0685343e1c-f3d1b99a743ffa4142d9d7f1978d9686.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/files/108780/width754/image-20160120-26082-kgyeqq.png)

She also [gave evidence](http://35percent.org/2015-05-02-aylesbury-estate-compulsory-purchase-order-public-inquiry/) at the Aylesbury CPO public inquiry showing how leaseholders were also being displaced, not just from the area but to outer boroughs and beyond as a result of the low compensation payments they receive. Of the circa 250 leaseholders 'decanted' off the estate to date, only 7 have taken up shared ownership on new homes provided by the scheme. 

Both [leaseholders](http://halag.wordpress.com) and [tenants](http://aylesburytenantsfirst.org.uk/) have set up action groups campaigning against demolition and for a more inclusive regeneration.
